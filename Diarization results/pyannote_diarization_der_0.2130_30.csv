The patient, a 45 year old female complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2 weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains, says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.

I am really suspecting that you might be having some form of malaria since you stay in a malaria endemic area and you do not sleep under mosquito net or insect repellent. In your family do you have anyone with this same problems? Your children or your husband, is there anyone with this form of, with a similar problem as this?

[Speaker 2]: Okay, my name is Adebayo Omowunmi and I consent to the recording of this audio.
00:09:22

00:11:28

[Speaker 1]: So today's topic is who or what defines morality. Morality is a concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on what defines it. Some believe that morality is determined by religious beliefs or cultural norms, while others argue that it is based on personal values and principles. Ultimately, who or what defines morality? Ultimately, the who or what defines morality is a complex and subjective topic, often influenced by a combination of factors such as upbringing, societal influences, and personal experiences. In this sense, mortality can be, morality can be seen as a fluid and constantly evolving concept shaped by individuals and collective perceptions and understandings. So, Bayo, what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality?
01:22:50

01:24:16

[Speaker 2]: Okay, this is quite a tricky question, says that what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? Well, one of the things that I've affected, that have greatly influenced my moral values, that would be my upbringing. You see, one of the, as we were growing up, at least up to the time I remember, I was living, I was conscious, but I remember my parents, they were very strict about what we did, our behaviour to ourselves and to others. And they always think about, and they always prioritize one thing, even aside our education and our religious activities that we have good, that we had good upbringing. Number one, one of the things that they taught us. So when in my early stages of life, good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever you see an elderly person, you greet the person. If you see, if you see somebody older than you, you know how to call him, maybe you call him brother so, so, so. Brother, brother Faith. Exactly. Uncle Faith. If he's much older than you or daddy Faith, depending on if he has given birth or daddy and all those simple etiquettes, those can, those are things, those are the moral values I was taught while growing up. Then it goes to, then we talk about societal influences. Now, when one of the things that also the time directly influence my, for us what they call my moral, my morality, that would be my social influences. Because while I was in school, even if I weren't taught by my parents, I would see how people were relating to other people. My younger people would talk to me. Hey, good afternoon, sir. When you see another person greeting the time of day. Good afternoon, ma. Good afternoon, madam. If you want to be someone, you don't know even his name, you know how to address the person. And if you, sorry, and if, and when you see somebody, even older than you want, you know how to address the person. So, and even if I didn't, like I said, even if I didn't see all these things around me, I was. I went to my place, I was all these things around me. So some of the things that influence my moral, my moral values.
03:49:29

03:50:04

[Speaker 1]: So thank you, Bayo but I also like the take something on that. All of the things that influenced my moral values is when I was young, when I used to grow up, I would be given, I'll be given something by many of my uncle or my auntie or someone I know. So when I'm given that thing, maybe my, my sibling will be with me and he will ask some of, some of it for me. Some children that were not well brought up, they would respond negatively that they were not going to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while we were young, they would have clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they will say, son, so that thing used to irritate my parents. And when I grow, also began to irritate me. But when I was young, my parents always taught me that when I asked or something, I will give, I must give, I should give. And even if I don't want to give, I would deny polite, in a polite manner, not show, up in your shoulder because that irritated them so much that they had to, they even had to caution some children that were not there or even when they, when they saw it. And what we done in my life, because of all these things that I've been taught, whenever someone asks me for something, it's always on my mind. That it, it is, that I should give it. But as someone, the person is asking, I'm releasing it, because I have conditioned my heart that once someone asks, you are going to give. And another thing in life is that the way that I've given people, given people that this person is good, that even when I've given him, he's going to give me. And even when I give him, even when he gives me, I'm going to give him. So all that mutual and vice versa cycle has always continued in my life and it has always helped me in my moral values. So over to the next topic, which is.
06:02:11

06:02:12

[Speaker 2]: Wait, let's not go dancing. Yes, let me, I have something to add. So I'll also ask you something. Now, one of the things also that my parents taught me growing up is that we always learn to share. Some other children will just look at it that, look at what I have, how can I share out of it. But one thing my parents always emphasize was that no matter how little or no matter how big it is, you always share. There was certain children in our house and neighbors. They had, they had, they had an only child for the child was about five. But five years later, they had the second born. The difference was about five years. So whenever they think they were born from the younger one, the older one will not share. The younger one was share because. And so if the other one wanted something, you have to steal from the other one. Maybe they take the thing off his hand. So only, you take your share and walk away. This caused a lot of this, problem for the, conflicts for the parents. Because they were always reporting issues. Hey, mom, this, this did to me. Hey, mom, this did that to me. It gave them a lot of problem, and this was because couldn't the children have to share? My parents foresaw this and make sure that no matter, even though I was, I had the little savings. No matter how much what I had, I always learned to share. No matter how small, what the condition, whatever I had, we shared. Whether it was much, whether it was little, whether it was even sufficient, we would share. We would just share it. That's one of the great moral upgrades that my parents gave me, which I'm gratefully appreciate it for. So I think we can go to the next topic now.
07:45:01

07:47:22

[Speaker 1]: And thank you, Bayo, for your contribution, for your contribution, and I would like to cite another example. At my place of work, there used to be, there was a, an executive officer that he was. He wasn't even really into sharing. This is not really into sharing, but I mean, that's moral value and a moral value. This executive officer, whenever he sees his, yes, thank you Bayo, his subordinate, it would not show the subordinate, expect the subordinate, to give greeting. He will greet before the subordinate. Even though the, even though he, some others, some people will feel that I'm in a higher position. This person supposed to greet me before I greet him, and he will not greet him, and if you don't greet me, I want to make sure you pay for it. But this man, this, this officer wasn't like that. Once he saw you, this, this is my, this is my, my friend, and this is my subordinate, he will greet and the person respond to him very politely. This also helped the relationship with other people, because there was even a time that. There was even a time that this man was sorry, so there was even a time that this man was. There was around his personality and his job. So it was questioned by the administrative, administrative office and the administrators. So when it was questioned, it was, it was, it was, the evidence again was against him. But when the peoples, when people heard about this, the subordinates , but when they heard about this, they were very confused that this man, this man is our friend that greet us well, how could he do such a thing. So the people, the officers were not satisfied with their, with their, what they did, what they had, they had concluded to do, to fire him or even demote him to a lower level. But when the, when I said, I mean, the subordinate were alerted, when they heard of this, they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done and they encouraged, they convinced, they successfully convinced their administrative on to, on his, his punishment, and they, they just gave me a second check, because it was not much of an offense, but they gave me a second chance and the man was not. They didn't take that from the.
10:31:41

10:37:11

[Speaker 2]: I also remember one of the, an instance where was, that was. When was that? Anyway, I had a story from my friends that there was. No, sorry, pardon me, let me give this example. I went to one of my friends house. We both grew, we both grew up together, we've known each other since high school. So we went to, I went to his house and already he has married and given birth. So we went, we went together for like a get together party. So I met him there, and everybody was discussing, because we were many hey, Lagbaja, we've not seen today, how is business, how is family, this and that, everybody discussing. In the height of all the laughter, everybody was happy relating with one another. That's when we sent for one child to get him what's the Chivita pack, because he wanted to, we just ran out of Chivita. So the girl wasn't happy that something conflict she had with her mom, so as soon as they grumbling, you know, the way these poor children behave, everybody was greatly appalled by her behaviour . Everybody turned to I said, who just displayed that character? Instantly the man was caught with shame, and my friend was caught to shame, and he said it again, in a louder voice. go do this and this, and even, she complained even louder to him. This, this, what can I say? It caught everybody's attention even more that wow? What again? Then instantly, then instantly. The next time, she said it a third time. And next thing, she went up to his feet, took his slipper, and she slapped the slipper against his face. Everybody was jaw dropped. I didn't even myself, I was, I didn't even know when my, literally, when my jaw just dropped. You can imagine what, how this girl had embarrassed her father, because her father couldn't teach her moral values. Let me also take you to one of the time when I went to my friends home, as I got there, I had heavy load because I had heavy loads. So as I got out of my car and I greeted, when they saw me, they couldn't even greet me, his children, they couldn't greet me. They were looking at me to take, even take my bag, they couldn't. But my friend had to tell them, hey, go and take his bag now, go and take his bag. They couldn't do that. So imagine how this lack of moral values have disgraced his father. It's affecting his family because those children will never listen to him respectfully. Who is this one now? Who is this one now?
13:18:39

13:18:49

[Speaker 1]: And Bayo, not only this family with this moral, lack of moral values affect, it will even affect the children's family, because they have not been taught so why would they teach their children?
13:30:11

13:30:12

[Speaker 2]: Exactly, because it's what, and it's because, and it's what they know now that they would treat their children. They can't just get off the roof of their heads and hey, people are supposed to do. That's what I'm saying, so this is what, this is what is affecting moral values. You see how moral value is affected. That's why I'm grateful for my parents teaching that, they talked me up and they brought me up very well.
13:57:40

13:58:55

[Speaker 1]: Thank you, Bayo. So can we proceed to the second topic?
14:00:42

14:00:43

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
14:01:54

14:02:56

[Speaker 1]: So Bayo what are some common factors that people use to determine what is morally right or wrong?
14:09:39

14:10:26

[Speaker 2]: Okay, now I had a very, I had a friend, she said that she was a very religious person. And when I tell you, a very religious person, I mean very religious person, it's not on the scale you think that she's, when I say religious person, I mean someone that is really, really, what can I say? Not biblical, but very religious. She believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong, that only God could do that. You can imagine that if anybody, and if we try to determine, to what's wrong or not, we won't be coy because we are not, we are not, humans are not perfect. I quite agree, but not in that sense. So, so what she did was that she, whenever she saw that, she, whenever she thought of anything that she would tell her heart that her God, what do you want me to do? Is this thing correct? Is this thing right? Is this thing wrong?  Is this thing morally correct? and this thing was quite, I must say, it was quite strange to me that what is this woman doing? It was a very odd way of going  to determine what is right and wrong. Yes. So let me give you another example, another thing, factor that people think to use to determine what is morally right and morally wrong. Some people, some people believe that society's accepted standards of behaviour often shape people moral compass. What a society accepts this, accept that you don't do this, that you don't do that, that is what they are. They believe in their, that's what they use there, is their moral compass. This is what our society accepts. This is what our culture accept, so this is what one of the things that determines what people do. So now what about our personal concept, conscience, intuition, people just use the, this thing I'm about to do, it doesn't feel right and if it's being done to me, I wouldn't like it. You might be such a selfish. I really appreciate that. I wouldn't like it. It wouldn't do it. This thing I'm about to do, is it really good? And another thing is that a personal reflection play a role. You reflect over what you want to do that what I, look at the consequences I want to do, Is it a good thing to do? Can I take it from someone else? and all these things play a role in guiding individuals to discern right from wrong. So then you also look at the. Some people assess the morality of an action based on its consequences. So they consider it. This is the concept of if I do this thing, this is the consequence if I don't do it. So they weigh their options, which one pays me, which one doesn't. So they do this to, aiming to maximize overall happiness and to minimize suffering. So let's look at ethical principles. Philosophical frameworks such as kantian ethics, virtue ethics and social contract theory provide guidelines for determining moral behavior. So some of the things, factors that, what can I say, that, common factor that people used to determine what is morally right or wrong.
17:29:32

17:32:04

[Speaker 1]: Thank you Bayo and I also like to give some, I also like to answer that question. So, some of the factors that also determine what is morally right or morally wrong is the legal, is the legal system. Because while laws may not always align perfectly with morality, they often reflect sociality, societal values and influence on individuals perceptions of right and wrong. So their perceptions of right and wrong, so most people think about legal system also part of what they used to determine the morality. For example, when you have a case, when you have a case with someone, a problem, maybe someone took your land, they said, this is where his land stop, this is where yours begins, and this is where mine starts. So when we attitude to the court, the court is not, you determine the, the outcome. Yes, the outcome of the case because they will use the evidence available with them that okay, this is, this is the, for example, this is the survey of the land. So if you, I don't care, you are correct. So that's how the law uses their legal system to, to determine moral values. So, Bayo, do you have anything else that you would like to say?
19:05:58

19:05:26

[Speaker 2]: No, I don't think so.
19:06:13

19:06:24

[Speaker 1]: Okay but I'm just listening. One last thing. So another thing is human rights. Because many people base their normal moral judgment on principles of equality, justice and the protection of fundamental rights. Because even when some people, when people have their own belief,  that okay, these are what I think, I believe that is correct morally, when they look at it in the eyes of this human activist, would I be correct? Because of this equality will I be correct? Because of the rights they claim for this, because of the rights that they claim for this person, would they like it? Would they take it from me? So the person would not like to align all these beliefs with what that other person's human rights says. So, Bayo, just to conclude, do you have any other thing you'd like to say?
19:56:01

19:56:11

[Speaker 2]: No, I don't. Thank you.
19:58:55

19:58:42

[Speaker 1]: Thank you Bayo.
20:00:50

20:00:24

[Speaker 2]: It's a very good conversation.
20:01:39

20:01:40

[Speaker 1]: Thank you for your contribution too. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]: Hello, my name is Chizoba. I consent to recording this conversation.
00:06:48

00:07:35

[Speaker 2]: Hi, my name is Murphy Victor. I consent to recording this conversation.
00:11:29

00:12:25

[Speaker 1]: All right, Victor Murphy, you are welcome to today's discussion. We will be talking about a very common practice these days, which was not there in the olden days, that came along with the introduction of Internet, something called online shopping. Victor, I know it's a very familiar word with you, because looking at you is very obvious that you are a new generation man. You are a 21st century man.
00:47:15

00:47:58

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
00:48:16

00:48:17

[Speaker 1]: So, Victor, can you please, a few words, explain to me what you understand as online shopping.
00:58:50

00:59:58

[Speaker 2]: Online shopping is very basic, is a. Is very easy to understand. It's basically the purchase of items, goods and how should I say, services too, because services are also included online, where you make the payments online and the goods are then delivered to you at your home, at the place of your convenience, either to your postal office or sometimes a home delivery. But everything, every transaction, the bargaining and everything is done online.
01:32:15

01:32:58

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so Victor, what you're saying is that online shopping is when somebody makes purchases online and they deliver the product to them in their place of residence.
01:52:40

01:52:50

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
01:53:05

01:53:26

[Speaker 1]: And sometimes it's not only are about goods, it can equally be services.
02:00:00

02:00:24

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:00:40

02:01:12

[Speaker 1]: Ok, that is very nice point, Victor, can I know if you have patronized online shopping before?
02:11:56

02:12:41

[Speaker 2]: Yes, about a few months back, I was in need of a phone.
02:16:17

02:16:36

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
02:16:55

02:17:08

[Speaker 2]: So I tried physical shopping for the phone, but the phone I wanted to buy was not available in my country, and the only way to get the phone was through a website, which is very popular, Aliexpress. Okay, so the Aliexpress only does is an online shopping platform. So in order to get the phone, I had to engage myself in online shopping actively, and then that was how I got the phone to my country. So, yes, I can proudly say that I've tried online part online shopping in the past and I still do to date.
02:50:39

02:51:07

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so what you are saying is that you bought your current fine phone that you're using right now online.
03:00:25

03:00:51

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
03:01:10

03:01:24

[Speaker 1]: From an international site called Aliexpress.
03:06:09

03:06:22

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
03:06:37

03:07:01

[Speaker 1]: Okay, Victor, is there any reason why you didn't buy from the local, the online shopping, or do you just prefer the one of international?
03:21:58

03:21:50

[Speaker 2]: No, that's one advantage online shopping has over physical shopping.
03:28:04

03:28:05

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
03:28:34

03:28:47

[Speaker 2]: Physical shopping is limited to the wares that the owner has.
03:33:11

03:33:26

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
03:34:03

03:34:30

[Speaker 2]: Online shopping gives you a variety, because online shopping opens your world of, like, the ability to be able to even purchase, like, different varieties of goods, even from the people making the goods themselves. Some of the people making the goods can actually, like, allow you to buy directly from them via online shopping. But these people that sell physically, they may not have different varieties of the goods because obviously they have, they, they work on a profit margin where they have to sell exactly what the market needs, their locality needs. So if they bring in goods and goods that their locality does not actually need, they'll make a loss. They will not sell that product. So they are supplied. The amount, the variety of goods they have in their physical stores is limited. So that's one advantage of online shopping.
04:27:42

04:27:53

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so what you're saying is that people who sell in physical store has a limited stock, stock amount of goods that they will sell. And online shopping also gives you ability to choose from different vendors. Is that what you mean?
04:45:50

04:46:01

[Speaker 2]: Yes. Yes.
04:46:35

04:46:36

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Victor, can I know if you had any problem shopping online before?
04:52:17

04:54:02

[Speaker 2]: I'll not say I actually had a problem, but I had phobia or fear.
05:00:29

05:00:49

[Speaker 1]: Fear? Ok
05:01:44


05:02:44

[Speaker 2]: Not phobia of trying it out, but phobia that I have tried it out because my goods took time to actually come to me.
05:12:07

05:12:22

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
05:12:45

05:13:59

[Speaker 2]: So I had this fear that it might get lost or something might, bad might happen to it or it may get delivered to a wrong location. But aside that I don't have any problem with online shopping, but eventually the good later got delivered. So.
05:28:49

05:29:58

[Speaker 1]: Got delivered to you?
05:30:58

05:30:20

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
05:30:33

05:30:33

[Speaker 1]: Can I know if the goods was good or was it spoilt? Because I do hear that sometimes people get their goods spoilt on the way while or like on the transit, when they are group their goods is still in transit, it gets spoilt or lost or something. Was your own like that?
05:47:45

05:48:04

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, it was in perfect condition.
05:49:22

05:49:32

[Speaker 1]: Okay. It was in perfect conditions. So if you're giving a chance again or. You will still shop more online or will you still like to shop more online?
06:01:55

06:01:55

[Speaker 2]: Obviously. Obviously. Obviously.
06:02:42

06:02:43

[Speaker 1]: So what you are saying?
06:03:32

06:03:32

[Speaker 2]: I like the ease with online shopping. I'll obviously try it again next time.
06:07:27

06:07:48
Speaker 1]: Okay. With the ease, you tend to enjoy shopping online more?
06:12:09

06:12:11

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
06:12:23

06:13:16

[Speaker 1]: How about the price difference? Don't you consider the fact that the price of offline market will be cheaper than the price of online marketing?
06:22:46

06:26:31

[Speaker 2]: It's subjective, but from my own experience is online shopping. Online shopping, most times the pricing is way lower than the pricing in the local markets. Most times, most times. Because not all shoppers do this. Not all. Sorry, not all market sellers do this, but some of them do shop for their goods online.
06:53:36

06:54:57

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
06:54:21

06:54:22

[Speaker 2]: And when they now shop their goods online, they now sell it at a higher price than the actual price. than the actual price. So if you can get access to the online vendors that they're buying it from, you can actually get it at the real original price without the added fee.
07:08:36

07:08:47

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
07:09:12

07:09:17

[Speaker 2]: So most times, shopping online can be cheaper than shopping in your local stores. Yes.
07:15:34

07:16:31

[Speaker 1]: So what you're saying is that online can be cheaper sometimes because you tend to get the goods from the original supplier, not from the retailers?
07:25:08

07:25:46

[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes, yes.
07:26:35

07:26:52

[Speaker 1]: Oh, that's very wonderful, Victor. Victor, can I know if you have any specific amount of goods that you can buy online or you can purchase any amount. You know, there are people that used to say that, I can't spend less than 10,000 or less than 100,000 online. Do you think you can purchase a product of up to a million naira online?
07:54:52

07:56:18

[Speaker 2]: Yes. Many people have that fear of purchasing online unless you are dealing with a website. You know, online shopping, you don't just. Online shopping is not just one shop. There are different, different websites selling stuff online. So they are amongst this websites there are trusted website in which they already have a track record of delivering goods to their customers, to their customer base. So those kind of websites, you are in 100% safe hands because they have measures in which that if you ever buy your goods and something bad happens along the way, you can always contact them and you can always have a way to get your goods back or something like that. So because of that security, spending a lot of money online doing online shopping is not actually a big problem because you are in safe hands if you go with the right trusted, vendors.
08:53:35

08:53:37

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay.
 So what you're trying to say is that you are very comfortable with shopping online, no matter the amount of money, once it is a reputable online market.
09:07:43

09:08:06

[Speaker 2]: Yes, online shop. Yes.
09:09:52

09:10:01

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay. That's a very interesting one, Victor. I do hope I join to shop online very soon. Now, if people ask you, do you advise them to really shop online or shop offline?
09:26:09

09:28:10

[Speaker 2]: Okay, online shopping is actually very enjoyable because, one, you don't have to like. You don't have to, you don't have to like. There's so many things that are in my mind. So that's why I'm just trying, taking my time to actually go through the thought process. You, there's more convenience because you can actually sit in your home and just click a button and get your stuff ordered to you. You understand? You don't have to actually leave and go to the crowded markets where you'll be struggling with other. Struggling with other shoppers. And you, you, yes, you get frustrated by the environment of the market. You know, how busy markets are now and how frustrating can. And sometimes looking for the item you want in a physical shop in a physical market can be quite stressful, especially if the market is big and you have to walk from one place to another to another. And sometimes, even though you go to the right place, sometimes they may not have the goods you want. Online shopping, most of these online shopping platforms, they made it very easy for you to find the thing you want. All you have to do is just do, just do a little magic with your keyboard, go to the search bar, type the thing you are looking for, and then you get a list, not just one of the item you want, you get a variety of the item you want and you can, at your own convenience, at your bed, even at your bed, choose the item you want and then just make your purchase very easy and fast, and then get your stuff delivered at the most convenient time.
11:16:12

11:17:57

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Wow. That is very interesting, Victor. So what you're saying is that with online shopping, you don't have to pass through the hassle of meeting a lot of people in the market and those walking around, especially in the very large market where you have to trek from one shop to another and make inquiries. But with online shopping, you can just click log into the site and just scroll and pick whatever thing you want without really meeting the seller. I believe you're this type of person that doesn't like all those cat calls that you get from the sellers.
11:54:00

11:54:01

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, yeah, that's very important. Fine boy, come here.
11:57:10

11:58:43

[Speaker 1]: Fine girl. What do you want?
12:00:05

12:00:05

[Speaker 2]: What do you want?
12:00:28

12:01:24

[Speaker 1]: I have it. I have it. Even when they don't, they don't know what you're looking for, but they're already shouting, fine girl, come, come, come. Well, Victor, you have a very solid point. I really agree with you that, shopping online is very interesting. Okay, so it's very, very interesting. But, I, I do hope that we in Nigeria get a strong shopping online platform because I've had a very bad experience where I, I was able to experience this common wish that they call, what I ordered versus what I got. Because there was a time I got a product and it was a product that has been, tampered with. I felt very bad. So that really discouraged me for some time from ordering from that site. So, but with your analysis these days, I think I will, I will try again to reconsider shopping online.
13:03:18

13:04:48

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, you should. You'll actually enjoy it.
13:07:57

13:07:57
Speaker 1]: Even though it gives a big man vibes. I hope I become a bigger man very soon so I can be able to spend millions of Naira
13:14:58

13:14:56

[Speaker 2]: You'll get there.
13:14:34

13:15:03

[Speaker 1]: Without really leaving the comfort of my zone because comfort of my home, because right now, everybody is looking for comfort. Whichever way you can give people comfort, they are ready to give you money. So online shopping to me is also interesting. According to how you described it, I can stay at my home and order. Would you like to tell my audience something else before we end the discussion? Victor, I have been enjoying your gist for some minutes now. For over 13 minutes. 
13:44:06

13:46:08

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. I just want to point out some disadvantages of online shopping.
13:49:32

13:49:33

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Outside the advantages of convenience and cheaper prices.
13:55:15

13:55:40

[Speaker 2]: Though online shopping is actually enjoyable and convenient and gives you variety of goods to choose from.
14:01:54

14:01:15

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
14:01:32

14:02:00

[Speaker 2]: One of the most like annoying part of online shopping, I'll not say it annoying to some, its annoying to some. To some, It's not annoying, but it's a con.
14:12:20

14:13:52

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
14:13:06

14:14:33

[Speaker 2]: Its delayed delivery.
14:16:56

14:16:22

[Speaker 1]: Oh, yes.
14:17:54

14:17:55

[Speaker 2]: Like in, unlike physical shores where items can be given to you immediately. This one, you have to wait for some time, some time for your stuff to be delayed to you. Then another one is weeks of fraud if you fall in the hands of the fraudulent vendors.
14:32:46

14:32:47

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
14:33:04

14:33:33

[Speaker 2]: So that's why I always suggest that you should go with reputable stores online. You should not just shop with anyone. The fact that you cannot bargain price.
14:41:44

14:42:10
Speaker 1]: Yes.
14:42:40

14:43:51

[Speaker 2]: You can bargain with some vendors. Yes. Like some, some do allow you to bargain, but most don't allow you to bargain. Especially the ones that are like websites. Yes. One page websites and those kind of ones that the price now already be set. You have to only be. The only way to make payments is just slot in your credit card and pay.  But some do allow you, especially if some of them are vendors that use social media accounts. You can actually bargain and chat with them. But most of them that are like big shops, shopping website like Aliexpress, Jumia and the rest, you know, the names, they don't allow you to bargain. I think that's all. That's all I want.
15:25:26

15:25:40

[Speaker 1]: Victor, thank you so much for this, your wonderful contribution. I really appreciate giving me your busy time tonight. Thank you, Victor.
15:34:04

15:34:36

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, glad having you.

[Speaker 1]: Good morning. My name is Nana Firdausi and I am giving my consent for this audio to be recorded.

[Speaker 2]: Good morning. My name is Aisha and I give my consent for this audio to be recorded. 
00:15:09

00:17:11

[Speaker 1]: So today I would like to discuss a topic with you. The topic is happiness versus peace. So overview happiness and peace are two concepts that are often used interchangeably but have distinct differences. Happiness is a subjective emotional state that is often associated with experiencing joy, pleasure, and satisfaction. It is a temporary and fleeting feeling that can be easily influenced by external factors such as relationships, achievements, and material possessions. On the other hand, peace is a state of mind that is characterized by inner calm, contentment, and harmony. It is not dependent on external factors, but rather a sense of inner security and acceptance. Peace is a long term state of being that is not easily influenced by temporary events or circumstances. In essence, happiness is a momentary emotion while peace is a state of being. While both are desirable goals, It is important to understand that happiness and peace are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to experience both simultaneously, but ones pursuit of happiness should not be prioritized over finding inner peace and balance in life. Sample discussion prompts: I was reading an article on happiness and it mentioned how some people prioritize peace over happiness. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it is possible to have both at the same time? Let me know what you think.
02:16:09

02:17:16

[Speaker 2]: Okay, thank you very much for this question. To be very honest, I think peace should be prioritized over happiness first, because I feel as humans, we have these fake crazy standards or definition of what we think happiness is. For instance, a lot of us don't see happiness as the very little things we tend to associate it with financial stability, an obsession with success just for us to feel among, or, you know, just for the fake standards set by the society. Like, oh, you are a lawyer, so you have made it in life. Oh, you are a doctor, so your life is made. So, as I've said earlier, for me, I will prioritize peace because peace is a state of being, just like you said in the introduction. Like, yes, I have made peace with myself not to get obsessed with success so much that will destroy me. I am. I have made peace with myself that I will find happiness in the very little things in my life. And for us to attain. Or let me say, for me to attain peace in my life, there's one very big thing I removed. It is envy or looking at someone else's pace in life like, ah, my friends are graduating, but me, I still have a spill. I have one year left. Once you start thinking about things like that, you will not have peace in your life because it will lead to envy, it will lead to jealousy, it will lead to hatred. You might even destroy your happiness in the process. So overall, I believe peace can be attained once you have conquered your mind to achieve it. And for someone that have found peace, happiness is not far from your reach at all. You are definitely going to find happiness. So, thank you. That's what I think.
04:37:00


04:37:14

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, I agree with you. Because personally, I think once you've found peace, happiness is not really out of your reach. Because, you know, to me, peace is, Whether this thing happens or not, I am okay with it. I am satisfied. Peace is more about satisfaction.You know, the point of making your. Mind or your soul feel relaxed, like you're bothered. Peace is not about being okay. Let me give you an example. I am bidding for a contract. Whether I get the contract or not, I have made peace with myself that. I won't let it bother me, but, Rather, if I get it, yeah, I will be grateful to God. I will, you know, appreciate my own efforts and be grateful to God. But if I don't get the contract, I am going to try again or see where the problem is. That is what I just feel Peace is all about. While happiness is just this crazy obsession of you perfecting your life, which is, you know, nearly impossible. So the first step to finding happiness is finding peace. So I'm going to be asking you the next question now. I've always believed that true happiness comes from inner peace. But I know some people who chase after happiness constantly. What do you think is more important, finding happiness or finding peace? Let me know what you think.
06:24:39

06:28:00

[Speaker 2]: So, as I've said earlier, me personally, I think happiness is not something that needs to be constantly chased if you've not attained inner peace. Because that is just you setting yourself up for destruction, I'm sorry to say. Why? There's no harm in chasing happiness. We should be careful about ways in which we chase happiness and put, you know, into consideration that we don't always get what we want in life. Except that some people use other means, of course, illegal means, to get them sometimes, which, you know, leads to their destruction. And ultimately it leads to them being temporarily happy or from being temporarily happy to be unhappy for life. So I rather people set their goals straight by them finding inner peace. Then go ahead to pursue happiness while being peaceful at heart. To be able to live a healthy and a truly fulfilling happy life. In conclusion, peace is what will give a man true happiness, and not just an illusion or temporary happiness. So the step is finding peace. You have to find peace to find true happiness. And that's what I think. That's final. Thank you very much for allowing me to speak.
08:07:36

08:10:55

[Speaker 1]: Wow, you've, You've made a lot of sense to me, too. I think you have to find peace to be truly happy in life. And I hope we all find peace and. Or let's say I hope we all make peace with whatever is going on in our lives. Because after finding peace, then happiness should not be difficult to find. Though I think peace is. Peace does not, Peace does not necessarily mean you're happy. It's just mean, Whether this works out or not, you choose to be at peace. Like, you are not bothered, you're not disturbed about whatever is going on, you know, in your life. So, yeah, I hope we all find peace and happiness in our lives. Thank you very much for having this conversation with Thanks you

00:10:03

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so today's topic is the church, state and politics. The relationship between the church, the state and politics has been a subject of debate and controversy for centuries. The church as an institute upholds significant influence and power over the state and political decisions. In many societies. Religion plays a crucial role in shaping the political landscape and influencing policies. However, the separation of church and state is also found, is also a fundamental principle in many countries where the government is not supposed to be under control or influence of a particular religion. The discussion around this topic often revolves around issues such as the role of religion in government, the extent of religious freedoms, and the impact of religious beliefs on political decision making. Ultimately, the relationship between the church, state and politics is a complex and ongoing dialogue with various perspectives and viewpoints. So one of our questions for today is what are our thoughts on the separation of the church and how and state and how it impacts politics? And do you believe religion should play a role in government decisions? Well, this is quite a handful. Well, I'll take the lead on this. So one of the first four. The religion should not have a part to play in politics. I know some. I know you will often ask why? Well, that's because religion is a very powerful thing. Because one of the key things about religion is that bad things about religion is that religion doesn't, doesn't need to be explained. Anything can be in religion. Religion can believe that the earth was made from sand and green sand and everybody would take it that way. Because that's what we know. It doesn't have to make sense. All it's just needs to be. Just to be that. And it's that. So because of this, religion is so, is bland, is so, is, uh, what can I say? Uh, is just there. So I wanted about politics, is that politics, one thing gives to the other. Without this, you can't have that. So when you are wanting, when you want to include something on, is like an uncertainty with a certainty. If the canton cannot mix together, there will be problem. I mostly look at religion. Religion believes that the count they should. Each religion believes that there should only be one religion. So because of this, this are one of the reasons why religion cannot coexist, cannot play a role in government decision. One thing about religion, religion also supports it also is that believes that they can only be one religion. Christianity believes that it is the only, is the only original one. And every other thing is counterfeit, is fit and it's fake and we leave them to destruction. So because of this, if religions start playing a role in political, in government decisions, it will cause a bias. When a christian president is unseat, you will be biased towards Islam citizens, even though they are of the same nation, you understand it cause marginalization and they cause problem in society, in the government. So, so another, and there's another thing. Well, let's also look at nations who have been, let's take the Iran, Iraq, all these nations for example. They are being ruled by religion and is having negative effects on them. Number one, when number one is constitutional, what can I say? It's causes a tighter picture because everything around them is Islam, Islam, Islam. And because of that, christians are not what can I say, are not motivated to go there. And this affects their economy because even if personally, even if there are some artifacts there, some choice attractions there, I wouldn't go there because of their religion. That is a religious state. So this is, and this is affecting the economy. So these are one of the reasons why, what can I say? Why religion cannot play or should not play a role in government decisions.
04:30:03

04:32:58

[Speaker 2]: Let me cut you there. Let me cut you there. I don't, I certainly do not agree with what you are saying. I agree. I certainly do not agree with what you have said because honestly I believe religion should have a play, I honestly believe, don't believe that religion should have a plain. Religion should have a play in the state and all others. Because when you look at it without religion, what are we, we have to draw closer to God. Imagine if we have, we are in a tie down now. And we don't, just like the country is ruled by nothing. We are just, there is nothing between us. There is no religion. The country should have a united liturgy and Muslim. And this, okay, this time when look at it, sorry, like Christians will rule in till 1960 to maybe 2020, then 2020 muslims will rule. Imagine it now the Christians imagine if Muslims have been winning consistently, the Christians will feel, the Christians will feel biased that probably, probably they are being cheated. But it will just be normal luck. But when everything is arranged according to religion, no one will feel bad cheated. So I believe that religion should be added to government.
06:07:06

06:09:26

[Speaker 1]: You should play a role in government.

[Speaker 2]: I'm Sunday, and I consent to recording this conversation.
00:05:51

00:06:23

[Speaker 1]: Today we'll be talking on a very interesting topic. Sickle cell disease. What can you say about this disease?
00:12:16

00:12:55

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Sickle cell disease is actually a hematological disorder. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that when it is inherited, except the two forms, two abnormal genes are inherited. If not, the person will not manifest with the disorder. So it is an autosomal recessive disorder which affect the beta chain of the. Of the globe of hemoglobin, you understand?  And then this beta chain, it's actually. At position six of the chain where there is replacement of glutamine by valine. And then it causes the blood, the blood cell to be sickle instead of a normal biconcave disc shape of the blood, you understand? And it makes it non deformable or it doesn't change shape easily when it is maneuvering or it's passing through blood vessels. So therefore, when it reaches capillaries, I mean, tiny vessels in the body, it becomes very. When there is deoxygenation, it becomes sickle shape. And this sickle shape prevents it from maneuvering this blood vessel, negotiating these blood vessels, and it sticks to the wall of the blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel, forming tactoids. And over time, if this process. If this process continues, it's like a vicious cycle. Because of the deoxygenation, there is formation of this tactoid. And because of the formation of this tactoid, there's further deoxygenation, which causes increased formation of this tactoid. And there's an obstruction of blood vessel, and it manifests in various ways, you know, so which is usually called sickle cell crisis, the acute crisis of sickle cell, and then there are chronic crisis of sickle cell.
01:46:39

01:47:44

[Speaker 1]: So from what I understand, from what you are saying, you are trying to say that sickle cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, right?
01:55:21

01:55:21

[Speaker 2]: Yes, that is correct.
01:56:27

01:56:27

[Speaker 1]: That means the blood. What is the lifespan of a sickle cell blood and then a normal blood?
02:01:32

02:01:57

[Speaker 2]: Usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about 120 days, while that of sickle cell blood, blood cell is about 10 to 20 days. Some say 10 to 30 days.
02:13:42

02:14:00

[Speaker 1]: Okay, you mentioned something again. That sickle cell happens when a child receives two sickle cell genes.
02:19:22


02:19:38

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:20:02

02:20:28

[Speaker 1]: So why do. That's one from each parent?
02:22:13

02:21:42

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:23:02

02:23:02

[Speaker 1]: That's when two carriers AS and AS marry their self. They are likely to have a child with SS, the sickle cell hemoglobin.
02:30:44

02:30:44

[Speaker 2]: Yes. or let me explain it. For someone, usually for someone with AS and AS, you understand? A is the normal, while S is the abnormal, which is a sickle cell. So AS - AS, when they get married, there's a 25% chance that each of their child can come out as a sickler or as a sickle cell disease patient. I'm not saying that there's a 25% child that all their children chance that all their children or their children will be sickle cell patient. No, it's not as if when you give birth to one, two, three, the fourth one will be sickle cell patient. No, that is not the chance. The chances are each of the child. They give birth to has a 25% chance of being a sickler. So it is even possible that all your children will not be sickle cell patient. And it's possible that all your children can still be. It's possible that two of your children, maybe out of four, can be. So it's just like that.
03:26:11


03:27:03

[Speaker 1]: Okay, thank you. So what are the symptoms of this sickle cell?
03:30:10

03:30:28

[Speaker 2]: Okay, I was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier. So the acute crisis include things like vaso-occlusive crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, sequestration crisis, and aplastic crisis. So what is vaso occlusive crisis? Now, like I explained earlier, there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid, and then this causes vaso occlusion. This is what they call vaso occlusion, and it leads to a crisis and painful
03:58:57

03:57:31

[Speaker 1]: Can you please explain what occlusion means.
03:59:21

03:59:41

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Occlusion means obstruction in a blood vessel.
04:02:31

04:02:31

[Speaker 1]: Okay
04:03:13

04:03:25

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. You know, the blood vessel is usually patents, allowing flow of blood. So when there is an obstruction by formation of this sickle cell, or tactoids, as the case may be, then it is called vaso occlusive crisis. And it can occur anywhere in the body, you understand? It can occur in the brain, where it is called cerebral crisis, acute cerebral crisis. It can occur in the chest, which is called acute chest syndrome. It can occur in the abdomen, which is called mesenteric crisis. It can occur in the penis, which is called priapism. It can occur in the bone. They call it bone pain crisis. You understand? And this crisis comes with pain, severe pain, usually, which they usually are admitted for. And this crisis can be precipitated by various activities or conditions, like infection, like malaria, for instance, can precipitate the crisis. Stress, stressful condition, dehydration extremes of temperature, like maybe high temperature or low temperature. So each of these conditions can predispose them to developing this crisis, you understand? So the second crisis is aplastic crisis, where there is infection of immature blood cells in the bone marrow by parvovirus B 19. And then this, if this affect the development of the maturation of this blood in the bone marrow, to normal blood. Blood cells, you understand? Or to mature blood cells, let me put it that way. So they become anemic. And then you see that they do not get enough. When they say a plastic means it's coming from the bone marrow, there's affectation of the red blood cell line from the bone marrow. Then the next crisis, which is a sequestration crisis, is as a result of pooling of blood from the systemic circulation into the spleen, usually it presents with abdominal swelling and distension, you understand? Because the spleen, they present with splenomegally, the spleen becomes very distended. And then it pulls the blood and then it leads to anemia, severe anemia, and usually managed on admission with careful transmission of aliquot. Although we are going of blood, although we are going to talk about management of this condition, second, then fourthly, which is the last crisis in acute crisis is the hyperhemolytic crisis. Like the name implies, hyper hemolytic may increase destruction of blood cells. You know, these blood cells are actually not, they're actually not normal. So usually each time they flow through the, they flow through the spleen or it circulates through the spleen. They are usually tagged as abnormal blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when, where there is, anytime there is deoxygenation. So the spleen keeps destroying these blood cells. That's why you always see them presenting with jaundice, you understand? Because there's constant destruction of the breakdown of the red blood cell. So this leads to, this is what is called hyper hemolytic crisis.
07:04:06

07:04:43

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so in summary, you're saying that sickle cell patients may suffer from chronic anemia, fatigue, pain crisis, and then jaundice.
07:13:56

07:13:14

[Speaker 2]: Yes. These ones I just listed are the acute crisis. They are chronic crisis too.
07:19:45

07:19:45

[Speaker 1]: That's like. Are they like the complications of sickle cell.
07:22:08

07:21:42

[Speaker 2]: These are complications?
07:22:53

07:23:13

[Speaker 1]: Yes. And I think they include things like organ damage.
07:25:24

07:25:42

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. These are actually long term chronic crisis, Like
07:30:00

07:29:02

[Speaker 1]:  Stroke
07:29:52

07:30:17

[Speaker 2]: Exactly. It can, sickle cell can manifest as stroke.
07:33:21

07:33:35

[Speaker 1]: What about infections? And then why do you think sickle cell patients, they usually have delayed growth like you see them, and then you see other normal children, they are all growing bigger. Then you see that the sickle cell child is left behind.
07:45:17

07:45:39

[Speaker 2]: Yes, This is called failure to thrive. Failure to thrive because usually they don't get enough oxygen. Their tissues don't get enough oxygen. So you don't expect the tissue that is not getting enough oxygen to grow well as normal as other cell, other people whose tissues are always getting enough oxygen. So they have this failure to thrive. Usually they're usually smaller than their pairs and the fact that they're always falling ill sick. So there are periods where they don't even get to eat well because they are sick for a very long period of time. So it affects them. You understand? So we are just saying something about stroke.
08:19:07

08:19:25

[Speaker 1]: Yes.
08:20:20

08:20:20

[Speaker 2]: Usually in adults, it's hemorrhagic stroke they do have. But in sickle cell patient, it is ischemic stroke. It's chemical in the sense that they don't get enough blood through the brain tissues, and then it leads to stroke. So let's talk about the chronic crisis.
08:35:02


08:35:02

[Speaker 1]: What about the infection? What kind of infection can they have?
08:38:56

08:38:10

[Speaker 2]: They can have any kind of infection. They can have malaria, they can have pneumonia, they can have even bone infections like osteomyelitis.
08:47:14

08:47:43

[Speaker 1]: Then finally, does the organ damage occur because there is no enough blood to this organ or is due to the infection? Like...
08:56:55

08:56:25

[Speaker 2]: It can come from both ways, you understand? Like I mentioned earlier, stroke is like a focal neurological deficit, a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit. That means the brain is being damaged. So when there is ischemic stroke, of course, blood is not really getting enough to the brain. So it can cause damage, you understand, of the blood of the brain. So the same thing with other organs, too. Enough oxygen is not reaching them, or, you understand, it can cause damage because there's like, kind of ischemia. There's not sometimes occlusion of the blood vessels.
09:26:47

09:26:59

[Speaker 1]: So what kind of medication do you think that sickle cell patients need? Like, actually, I know that they will have a lot
09:33:34

09:33:34

[Speaker 2]: Okay, before, before I get to that, I want to talk a little about the chronic crisis, which we have. The cardiomyopathies affecting the heart. We have retinopathies, the... sorry sickle cell retinopathies affecting the retina of the eyes. And then we also have sickle cells, sickle cell nephropathy affecting the nephrons, you understand? So these are some of the chronic crisis. Over time, there's accumulation, and then there's repeated ischemia to these tissues, and then it affects them. You get the point. So now talking about management of sickle cell patients, it's not a curable disease anyways. Although we've heard about stem cell transplants in developed countries, however, in a country like ours, usually is being managed. And management of this involves a lot of effort and involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient, the caregiver of the patient, and also the hospital, the facility where the patient is actually being managed, you understand? So first of all, you give some medications which help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have.
10:41:22

10:41:22

[Speaker 1]: Like pain relievers.
10:42:35

10:42:35

[Speaker 2]: No, this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises they have. I'm talking about medications like. Like malaria, chemoprophylaxis. This time around, it's usually fansidar they give, you understand? So they give them fansidar once a month. That helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria, you understand? It's a prophylaxis from malaria. Hydroxyurea is also given, which helps in increased production of fetal hemoglobin, which also have increased affinity for oxygen. It helps them reduce the crisis, the frequency of crisis as well. Then they are usually giving folic acid too, you understand? They are not giving iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of red blood cells. So they are not usually giving iron.
11:27:57

11:27:51

[Speaker 1]: I also heard that they advise to take water frequently, avoid stressful exposure, and then, and then exposure to extremes of temperature, like extremes of heat and cold. So how is it being managed when they're in crisis?
11:41:42

11:43:52

[Speaker 2]: Okay, it's usually depending on the crisis they present with, you know? So for instance, for someone who presents with vessel occlusive crisis, you're usually in pain, then they are giving. Usually management involve pain management. Where they are giving painkillers, usually they are giving pentazosine. And also you want to rehydrate them because some. Most times they come with dehydration and you are being rehydrated with one and a half maintenance, you understand? That is one and a half maintenance for normal individual. And then you want to also check whether they have infection, because most times infection precipitates like malaria or pneumonia, as the case may be. You also manage with antibiotics or appropriate antibiotics or anti-malarial to treat the infection. You also want to give oxygen if there is need for that. The same way if they present with acute chest syndrome, you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen. You also want to do chest physiotherapy for them. And sometimes it may require for you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement. In the same way, if they're present with sequestration crisis, you are going to transfer, you may have to transfuse them, but then you transfuse in aliquot. That is, you don't transfuse everything at once because it is risky. The spleen may just decide to release the blood into the circulation at once and it will lead to excess blood in circulation, which is in itself is also bad.
13:09:46

13:10:45

[Speaker 1]: I feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage this sickle cell, we should find ways to even prevent it from occurring at all. Like, how do you think apart from people advice to am people with the genotype AS and AS are advice not to marry each other. But some of them are not even aware of this. So I think there should be more awareness and more counseling. And then before marriage, people are supposed to go on screen and know their genotype. I hope you know your genotype.
13:37:54

13:38:09

[Speaker 2]: Yes, I know my genotype and I agree with the point you are trying to make. It's actually apart. So they are also. People are also to go for marriage counseling, you understand, especially by professionals in the society, like coming to hospital, as the case may be, or even if it's in churches that are well informed, they should go for marriage counseling so that they'll be counseled properly to avoid this condition, you understand? People also talked about permanent cure or treatment for this condition. Well, I heard in some countries, in some very advanced countries and facilities, they do stem cell transplants, your bone marrow transplant, and this helps to cure the condition. However, it is very expensive at the moment. Very few people can afford it. However, there are new researches going on. There are novel researches going on with the hope that they will come up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure this condition. It is our hope that as time goes on, we will find a cure, a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia, And then this condition will not be a problem to the world.
14:47:53

14:48:50

[Speaker 1]: Living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the sickler and then the families and the loved ones of the sickle. And then I feel like we should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with the disease. They should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle, that their health condition can handle, and then they should be allowed to socialize, and then they should be allowed to also have relationship study, some kind of course, all kind of courses that they actually desire. There should be no stigmatization. The whole society should come together to support these people, because already they are already going through a whole lot.
15:25:12

15:26:52

[Speaker 2]: I agree with you on that.
15:26:46

15:27:19

[Speaker 1]: And then once again, you are all advised to know your genotype. If you haven't done that, try to do that today. And try to also let us all come together to totally eradicate sickle from our society, know your genotype.
15:39:17

15:39:36

[Speaker 1]: Hi, my name is Salima Kashim Saliho, and I consent to the recording of this audio.

00:05:49

[Speaker 2]: And my name is Fredriu Kashim Salihu, and I consent to the recording of this audio.
00:08:22

00:10:11

[Speaker 1]: So, Fajilo, nice having you once again. Well, today we're going to be talking about which is more important, creativity or knowledge. So, you know, what is different when you think about creativity and knowledge? What strikes the difference between the two?
00:23:59

  00:25:56

[Speaker 2]: I think creativity, in modern society, creativity is more independence than knowledge, because knowledge, someday, like knowledge, it comes, like through. When you get knowledge. Some people, when attaining knowledge, they go through government works and all those stuff. But creativity can be more independent.
00:46:51

00:48:24

[Speaker 1]: All right, so creativity is more. Knowledge is more restricted. You gain knowledge from someone else. Creativity is inbound, inborn, right. It's something that just comes from within, correct?
01:00:20

01:00:20

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
01:00:22

01:01:57

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So the debate over whether creativity or knowledge is more important has been a long standing topic of discussion among philosophers, scholars, and innovators. Both creativity and knowledge are essential elements in our lives. You agree with me on that, but there is no consensus on which one should be given more weights. Well, if you are to ask me, I would say both are very important. You need knowledge. You, you. It's good to be creativity.
01:28:51

01:30:37

[Speaker 2]: You need. You actually need knowledge to apply the creative aspect that you have.
01:35:03

01:36:30

[Speaker 1]: Exactly. You need that knowledge. But if you have only knowledge, without creativity, you are just like any other person. There's nothing special about you. You need to be creative for your knowledge to stand out. So, on one hand, knowledge is often perceived as the foundation of progress and advancement, while on the other hand, creativity is viewed as the driving force between innovation and originalism. In this ongoing debate, some believe that knowledge enables individuals to think critically and solve problems efficiently, while others argue that creativity allows for the exploration of new ideas and solutions. Ultimately, the importance of creativity and knowledge may depend on individual perspectives and context. So now for the. I want to ask you a question. What do you think is the key to success? Is it being creative or having vast knowledge on a topic.
02:21:28

02:23:20

[Speaker 2]:  both are more important, but I think it leans more towards creativity in the current society that we are being creative, because knowledge. Knowledge is some. The knowledge is the key to success, but when that knowledge isn't able to be applied practically, won't really have any effect in society.
02:45:15

02:46:43

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so you. Creativity has a higher standing in the. If you have to put it in the balance, creativity will be weighing higher, right?
02:53:40

02:53:47

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:53:49

02:55:22

[Speaker 1]: Okay, I agree with you on that. So what has been your personal experience in balancing creativity and knowledge in your work or personal life.
03:02:41

03:06:44

[Speaker 2]: Like creative creativity. I'm still a second, I'm still a university student, but when it comes to creativity, I'm more focused on artwork and stuff like that.
03:17:04

03:18:53

[Speaker 1]: All right, so how you are more focused on artwork. Right. But you talked about you being a secondary school student, right or  university student right. Okay, so you do know that there's a way to apply creativity into your studies. Yes, there is. You know? Right. So what comes, what kind of methods have you thought about and have you tried applying them?
03:44:30

03:48:47

[Speaker 2]: I personally, I haven't applied any creative aspect to my, my university life, but I think when applying creativity to your university life, stuff like engineering. When it comes to engineering, there are some stuff you can do outside of academic work that can help you earn money and stuff like that.
04:11:05

04:12:29

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Being a bit fake, but I think I understand what you're trying to say. For me, when I think about creativity in studies, I'm thinking about, oh, how you and I are reading for both reason. Reading for 12 hours, right. In a day. Let's just assume that I read every 12 hours in a day. You also read 12 hours in a day. You read a whole 12 hours in a stretch. Maybe you only take breaks to eat or have a short nap or something like that, but then I read for the same 12 hours. But then maybe every 30 minutes I take a break, I just draw something, I scribble something down, or I just write a design or look up a dag, a cursive handwriting, a new course of handwriting and put it down. You know, just things that fancy my fancy, fancy my liking. For me, it's art. For somebody else, it might be music. So you might just take that break and use to bring your brain back to recover your brain, you know, drag your brain. Because the truth is that when you study, your brain tends to wear like your brain is being strained. So you have to bring jack your brain by bringing, rejuvenating it with things that it actually likes. So somebody who's creative will put those things in between reading times, while someone else who is like you, who is reading for that 12 hours will only stop when he needs to. Like maybe he needs, he's feeling sleepy, then he goes to take a nap, which is good. It's actually a great, it's a great plan. And also maybe he needs to, he's hungry, he goes to take a simple meal and come back. But I feel like the one who's taking breaks and being creative about it is going to have grasp more because the brain is looking forward to those breaks. I don't know if you get what I'm saying, but basically, I think that's how you apply creativity to studies. There are many other ways you can apply creativity to studies. Tooth tip of the iceberg. But also if you think about many other aspects in life. Let's talk about football. Because I know you love football. You can have all the knowledge about football that you want to, but if you don't have the skills, you won't prosper. Right? And even if you have the skills and you are playing football, if you're not creative about it, you won't stand out. What do you think makes Ronaldo and Messi stand up? They are creative about how they play. That's what makes them stand out in their. In their field. So I feel like creativity is just a topping that makes you stand out in whatever field you are in. If you're an engineering student, you stand out. If you're a pharmacy student, you stand out. Is there anything you want to add about this topic before we round off?
06:42:02

06:44:05

[Speaker 2]: I think that's all. Okay.
06:44:12

06:45:42

[Speaker 1]: You don't have anything else to add? Okay. Thank you very much, Fidel, for being here today.
06:47:52

[Speaker 1]: Good afternoon. My name is Amina and I consent to the recording of this audio and together with me is?
00:07:00

00:07:12

[Speaker 2]: Hafsa, also consent for the recording of this audio.
00:09:42

00:10:20

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So, dear Hafsa, I want us to discuss about what makes a good leader. Alright. I think a leader is a person that many people are under him. He is responsible for, he is responsible for the so many administrations. So then how can we know that this is a good leader?
00:28:56

00:30:11

[Speaker 2]: Well, well, well, this is a broad topic, actually, but let's just talk, you know, basically. Not actually the practical terms. So basically, when you say someone is a good leader, we need to talk of his dignity, you know, definitely dignity inside honesty, you know, generosity. Plenty of stuff, actually.
00:53:33

00:53:35

[Speaker 1]: But then how can we know that this is an honest person? He's generous.
00:57:14

00:57:23

[Speaker 2]: Well, it's very hard, actually, because, you know, politics, let's say leaders, when they are looking for positions, you know, they tend to form holy, holy.
01:04:48

01:05:10

[Speaker 1]: Yes, I've witnessed lots, lots of incidents.
01:08:28

01:08:28

[Speaker 2]: So you see, you just have to work with what you can see. But then think beyond that, actually.
01:12:50

01:13:08

[Speaker 1]: But then, okay, then, a good leader, I think based on me, if we are looking for a good leader, we need to check for the quality, such as his ability to guide, honesty, as you said, generosity. And is it man of his word? Yes, yes politeness, is it, is this person a harsh person?
01:38:38

01:38:47

[Speaker 2]: It shouldn't actually be entirely polite. We need some, as a leader, you have to be. yes, polite somehow, but then you have to be somehow strict. So in between, something in between, actually.
01:48:33

01:49:04

[Speaker 1]: Because his administration can decide to share some. Yes. Then what if after voting, the leader happens to fail from what he said he would do? Maybe we find out that he's a bad leader. Then what do you think can we do? Can we just impeach him? Or we have to wait? Or are we supposed to fight him?
02:11:14

02:11:41

[Speaker 2]: Well, let's take most of African, let's say a democratically operating system. The impeachment is actually left for the Senate. They are our representatives. Then they decide what to do. Maybe when they hear about the complaints. That is, in theoretical aspect, that you can find that in a constitution, let's say for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, you can impeach a president or a leader. But then that's basically to be honest in theoretical terms, in practical aspect. Now, if you're talking about peers, if. you're.
02:43:51

02:44:54

[Speaker 1]: You are to dive into the practical.
02:45:24

02:45:26

[Speaker 2]: It's very hard, actually. Honestly. We had a professor taking us a course. What he actually said that the only reasonable, practical thing you can do about it is just to be patient, you know, all those protests or whatever.
03:01:45


03:02:17

[Speaker 1]: Yes, this patient that you said, you just.
03:04:34

03:04:36

[Speaker 2]: Have to be, I'm coming, I'm coming. You just have to be patient and then wait for the next period of election and then don't vote for that person into power again. So basically that's the most.
03:13:55

03:14:26

[Speaker 1]: What if it's in a hard time? Do you think that patiently waiting, won't it say there is.
03:21:43

03:22:30

[Speaker 2]: What do you think a common man is going to do about it? What do you think a common man is going to do about it? He has no power. Yes, he has some rights. Let's talk. Okay, let's not dive into, you know, but let me give you an example so that you understand where I'm headed. Let's take Nigeria as a case study. In the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, your fundamental human rights are guaranteed, and also there are some rights that is right to education, you know, right to, right to, right to health, health, right to quality water. It is your right. But do you know that that same constitution that granted you that right under section two also limited that thing. That you cannot go to court of law to enforce that right. That means you cannot go to court of law to say that this leader has not provided me with quality water. Therefore I call for enforcement of my right. That same constitution has prohibited that. So tell me then, what is the hope of the common man? Patience. You just have to be patient. Do you say you'll come out and riot, you know, yeah, you can do peaceful protest, but then what does it result to actually does it profer solution?
04:27:43

04:28:25

[Speaker 1]: I don't think so.
04:29:13

04:29:14

[Speaker 2]: The practical thing is just to be patient and then vote for the next senior and then don't vote for that person.
04:34:03

04:34:03

[Speaker 1]: Yes, yes.
04:35:55

04:35:56

[Speaker 2]: So what practically you are supposed to do then before you vote that particular person, don't go beyond, you know, they give. you spaghetti and then you just go and vote. Just be reasonable, you know, try to see, do you see potential in this person and then vote it so that's.
04:52:24

04:52:46

[Speaker 1]: Yes, Let's talk about our own beliefs. Our own beliefs, let's say my own beliefs. What are the values that I want to see in a leader? A leader, I think based on my own, the values that I want to see in a leader, he should be trustworthy. That's the most important thing I think. Trustworthy.
05:11:34

05:13:56

[Speaker 2]: Yes, actually that's why I keep on repeating in theoretical time, how are you going to know that this person is actually a trustworthy?
05:20:34

05:20:34

[Speaker 1]: Research based on the previous, let's say, offices he holds, his previous activities. Yes, we know that a human being can change. But, you know, let's say he, he stayed in office for 20 years. Then definitely, if you want to go to research deeply, we will know what he did in that office for the past 20 years. What do you think is. Am I making sense?
05:44:19

05:45:11

[Speaker 2]: Well, you are making sense, actually but then.
05:48:25

05:49:17

[Speaker 1]: Yes, that's my only.
05:50:52

05:52:16

[Speaker 2]: Have some traits of you know, corruption.
05:53:55

05:54:05

[Speaker 1]: Yes, definitely, one way or the other, That's  incapacity, human incapacity. But then if we are to check, we will know that, yes, this is better than that. That is better than that person. You know, we cannot say all humans are equal. Definitely. There's a better person and there's the worst person. Okay. Then apart from trustworthy, I think the next thing that's supposed to be is, the next person, the next quality that we have to check for is, what, what do you think? Tolerance. Right?
06:23:14

06:25:46

[Speaker 2]: You know that tolerance. I'm not actually sure. Okay. When you say tolerance, does that mean a leader should tolerate any rubbish?
06:32:02

06:32:12

[Speaker 1]: No. Level of tolerance. Level. You know, there's level to everything. Let's say there's, he's, if he's not able to tolerate people, let's say, for example, he went to a particular place to see his people, and then they started shouting, we no they do, we no they do. Do you think that if he's not, he will not tolerate them, he will say, maybe his soldiers should start shooting them. So there's a level of tolerance.
07:00:00

07:00:01

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, to some extent. To some extent, yes.
07:04:03

07:04:26

[Speaker 1]: And then a leader should have this, What? I don't know how to put this, but then he should be, he should have this quality that he loves his people.
07:13:10

07:14:31

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. He should be patriotic to his nation and all that.
07:18:01

07:18:26

[Speaker 2]: Which I think puts your, you know, your subjects, the people you are leading, that is, carry them. They should be your utmost priority.
07:28:56


07:29:52

[Speaker 1]: Yes 
07:30:00

07:30:05

[Speaker 2]: So we hope for good leaders, and we pray that our leaders will continue to be patriotic
07:35:06

07:35:07

[Speaker 2]: Amen. Amen. So help us God.
07:37:12

07:37:26

[Speaker 1]: Yes. So, in conclusion, can you just tell us briefly what leaders, our leaders should do to us? What they should give back to their community.
07:48:31

07:49:44

[Speaker 2]: And they should provide necessary amenities, you know, health, education and all that. And also they should work on trying to see that our fundamental human rights are being duly followed, you know, duly observed. Exactly.
08:05:53

08:07:07

[Speaker 1]: Yes. I think that's basically what they're supposed to do. Know that they should make sure that their people have food. That's the important thing. They should remove their people from poverty.
08:16:22

08:16:45

[Speaker 2]: Poverty alleviation.
08:17:43

08:19:30

[Speaker 1]: I think we've done a little bit justice to the topic. Right?
08:23:29

08:24:26

[Speaker 2]: Well, we've practically, we've done justice to it.
08:27:57

08:27:49

[Speaker 1]: Alright? So thank you. Thank you for coming on board with me.

00:08:36

00:10:17

[Speaker 2]: My name is Haruna Nuhu. I also consent to recording this audio conversation.
00:16:30

00:17:36

[Speaker 1]: Thank you so much for joining in the conversation. The topic I would like us to discuss how the western culture has affected African dressing. You see, Mr Haruna, over the centuries, the western culture has had a significant impact on African dressing. Isn't it so?
00:45:20

00:45:53

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, of course.
00:46:46

00:46:46

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. So from the arrival of european explorers and missionaries to the influence of colonialism and the spread of western media and pop culture, the traditional attire and fashion of african cultures have been greatly influenced and adapted. Also, you see, the influence of western culture on african dressing has been profound, reshaping traditional attire and fashion trends in multi faceted ways from historical encounters to contemporary global interactions. This cultural exchange has produced a dynamic fusion of western and African styles, altering both aesthetics and production of clothing across the continent. And so now over to you, Mr Haruna. Do you have anything to say about how the western culture has affected the African dressing in any way?
02:14:05

02:14:33

[Speaker 2]: Thank you very much, Fatima. Yes, of course, you know, I have a lot to say regarding this discussion or this topic, but I think, first of all, I would like you to, you know, first of all, you know, go through this question. You know, I know you are a professional, so I want you to, you know, enlighten us and, and educators briefly regarding this question. I'm going to ask you now, Fatima. I would like you to. What are your thoughts on how the influence of western culture has changed traditional African dressing styles and fashion trends? Do you think it has a positive or negative impact on preserving cultural identity through clothing?
03:14:50

03:16:50

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Nice question, Mister Haruna. Okay, you asked the impact on traditional African dressing styles, right? And cultural identity, isn't it?
03:33:20

03:33:44

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
03:34:23

03:34:23

[Speaker 1]: You see, the impact of western culture on traditional african dressing styles has been extensive. You see, western fashion trends have introduced new materials, new designs and even new, you know, tailoring techniques into african clothing. Take for instance, the adoption of western style suits, dresses and casual wears has become prevalent, especially in urban centers. And this fusion has created a diverse and electic fashion scene in Africa, you know, blending indigenous motifs with modern cuts and fabrics. However, this influence has, you know, also raised concerns about the preservation of cultural identity through clothing. As western fashion gains prominence, there is a risk of diluting or overshadowing traditional African attire. And some argue that this shift undermines cultural authenticity and erodes unique sartorial practices that reflect african heritage. Yet others see it as, you know, a cultural evolution showcasing Africa's adaptability and creativity in responding to global influences while maintaining cultural roots. So I think this is the little I can say for now. And, okay, over to you, Mr Haruna, what exactly is. Is one specific aspect or element of traditional African attire that you think has been influenced or adapted by western culture? So tell me, I want you to tell me, how do you feel about this incorporation and its impact on the overall style of African dressings?
06:22:14

06:25:36

[Speaker 2]: All right, thank you so much, Fatima, for allowing me to say one or two things regarding this topic. You know, incorporation of traditional elements in western influence, Africa dressing. You know, one specific aspect of traditional Africa attire that has been, you know, influenced by western culture is the use of textiles, you know, and print, print and print, you know, traditional, traditional African fabrics like kanti, moth clothes and Ankara, you understand, have gained international recognition. Yes. Yes. And now, you know, incorporated into western fashion designs. So, you know, and this closer cultural exchange has elevated the status of Africa textiles globally and showcasing the beauty and craftsmanship of indigenous weaving and dying techniques. You know, the inco incorporate. The incorporation of our traditional element into western influence. African dressing has had a positive impact on the overall style. It has empowered, African designers to interpret traditional motives in contemporary context, appealing to broader audience while celebrating cultural heritage. This hybrid approach, this hybrid approach of fashion exemplifies the spirit of cultural fashion and innovation, you know, highlighting Africans rich history and creativity on the. On the. On the global stage. So, yeah, so I think, Fatima, can you make a conclusion, you know, regarding this topic we have just discussed so far?
09:13:22

09:14:35

[Speaker 1]: Okay. All right. Thank you for your contribution.
09:18:33

09:18:38

[Speaker 2]: Thank you very much.
09:19:36

09:19:36

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Thank you. You see, it's essential, actually, to acknowledge the agency of African communities in navigating cultural exchanges and shaping their identity through clothing. You see, while western influence has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on African dressing, the ongoing dialogue between traditional and modernity continues to inspire new forms of sartorial expression that are both culturally rooted and globally resonant. Okay. This interplay underscores the transformative power of fashion as a conduct of, you know, cultural exchange, self expression in a rapid changing world. So I would like us to give a pause here. Thank you so much for joining in the conversation. Thank you for joining.
10:41:11

[Speaker 2]: My name is Victor. I consent to recording this conversation.
00:08:57

00:10:00

[Speaker 1]: Right, Victor? You're welcome. Today we'll be talking about something that is popular, that is cut across almost all the cultures. Something that a lot of people know about. And many people always look forward to it. Victor, can you guess?
00:30:32

00:31:30

[Speaker 2]: I can't guess.
00:31:57

00:32:23

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
00:32:43

00:32:52

[Speaker 2]: Is it birthday?
00:33:32

00:34:37

[Speaker 1]: Exactly. Victor will be talking about birthday today. So I know that everybody alive has a birthday. But this time around, I don't know if everybody alive really does the birthday celebration type of thing. So, Victor, can I know what you think of birthday? What do you understand as birthday? Or what's? What's your simple explanation or definition of a birthday?
01:04:33

01:05:51

[Speaker 2]: Birthday, in the simplest definition, is a special day set apart to remember the day you were born. And its mostly held on the month and the dates that you were giving birth to. Your official date of birth.
01:21:33

01:22:11

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so birthday is something that people. celebrate every year right? To remember the other year or the other, other, other year that they were giving birth to.
01:34:09

01:34:10

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
01:34:25

01:35:03

[Speaker 1]: Okay and its celebrated the same day and month. Okay, so, Victor, this birthday celebration, I learned that its for only rich people, that poor people don't celebrate birthday. Do you think that is true?
01:51:21

01:52:07

[Speaker 2]: Poor people don't celebrate birthday. Actually, actually its subjective, because some rich people don't like celebrating their birthday.
02:04:32

02:05:25

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
02:05:45

02:06:08

[Speaker 2]: But I'll not remove the fact that to celebrate your birthday, you actually need money. So, some people, because of their poor, they have many problems in their lives, so birthday is the least of their worries. So, the highest they can get on their birthday is just a happy birthday. But most times they just even forget their birthday because they're going through a lot. So birthday is the last thing on their mind.
02:31:05

02:32:30

[Speaker 1]: So what you're saying is that a lot of people don't remember to really celebrate 
their birthday probably because of what they are facing.
02:41:19

02:41:39

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:42:59

02:42:20

[Speaker 1]: Okay, Victor, can I know when last you celebrated your birthday?
02:48:33

02:49:53

[Speaker 2]: Just a few months ago.
02:50:52

02:51:02

[Speaker 1]: Few months ago?
02:52:59

02:52:09

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
02:52:25

02:52:45

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so that few months ago, did you really remember that it was your birthday or someone reminded you?
02:58:42

02:58:43

[Speaker 2]: No, I remembered. I remembered. But obviously, sometimes I used to forget it's my birthday. Like, the previous year, I forgot it was my birthday. My birthday passed. Like, can you imagine, like, for somebody to forget the day they were born. Like, I didn't put too much value into birthday, because I felt birthday is just an ordinary day like, it's just. So if I should be sadistic, some people do view birthdays as one year closer to your death. So to them its not something special. Just another day, just a day they were born. Nothing much. Nothing. Nothing to see there.
03:38:34

03:40:23

[Speaker 1]: Alright. So you, few months ago, you celebrated your birthday. Can I know, Victor, if there is any of those, your birthdays that you find very, very special or the one that had some events that made you, it very memorable for you. That you can say, I can't forget my second two years old birthday, three years old birthday or any of those.
04:05:09

04:05:15

[Speaker 2]: I can't actually remember the year or the age I was in but I'll not call it my personal birthday. Because on my personal birthday, the highest they did for me, was happy birthday and it ends there. Nothing special. Maybe my mom bought chicken that day and we cooked it, just a remembrance of me and ended there. No special events, no special stuff happened but something later happened. Because few weeks after that, my parents decided to do a general birthday to celebrate everybody in our house. So we did it in a large way. My parents invited people to our house, our compound. We celebrated all our birthdays in one day. I know it's funny it's funny yeah. It does not normally happen in some families.
04:58:39

04:58:39

[Speaker 1]: Family of Victor Demas.
05:00:14

05:00:15

[Speaker 2]: It does not happen in some families but my father had to do it and that day, something special happened. My father did us a special surprise. He bought us really expensive, table tennis board where we can use and play table tennis. So up to date, that table tennis is still there. So, I think that was the most memorable birthday celebration. Even though it was not my birthday. It was a family birthday. It was the most memorable. Something close to a memory birthday I had.
05:35:22

05:36:28

[Speaker 1]: So say the one that you people had generally as a family was your most memorable birthday. Wow. So outside that, your normal birthday, what, don't you think about, cake? Because, I learned that, I see that most people, they see birthday as a day that they have to purchase cake or eat cake or I, share cakes to their friends. Do you think that without cake there will be no birthday or something? Birthday celebration. Do you think that cake is extremely necessary for birthday? That people cannot celebrate birthday without cake?
06:28:48

06:32:15

[Speaker 2]: Birthday is a symbol of, sorry, cake is a symbol of birthdays. Like, it's something attached to birthdays. Like, literally, if you see a cake with candles in a picture, obviously, you know, it was, its used to remember somebody's birthday. It signifies birthday. Just like, chicken, like turkey, represents Easter, thanksgivings.
06:58:06

06:58:34

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
06:58:50

06:59:25

[Speaker 2]: Same way with bunnies represents Easter thanksgiving. Rice, rice and stew represent Sundays.
07:08:07

07:09:54

[Speaker 1]: That's Nigeria only.
07:10:09

07:10:17

[Speaker 2]: Nigeria only. So cake represent birthdays. It's, it's, I don't know where the tradition started, but it has been there for a long time.
07:18:55

07:18:12

[Speaker 1]: Do you think it's Nigerian tradition or it's foreign?
07:21:58

07:21:19

[Speaker 2]: Should be foreign because our old fathers never knew what cake was.
07:25:42

07:26:02

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so how do you think that your old father celebrated their birthday? Or they don't celebrate birthday?
07:33:20

07:33:38

[Speaker 2]: I don't think they celebrated their birthday.
07:34:52

07:34:53

[Speaker 1]: So what you're saying that birthday is not a tradition of your ancestral home?
07:39:02

07:39:10

[Speaker 2]: Because if you ask some of these, our great grandfathers and our grandfathers that are still alive, some people are lucky to have their grandfathers. That's, that's actually good. So, but if you ask them, most of them don't know their age.
07:51:18

07:51:48

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
07:52:16

07:52:22

[Speaker 2]: They don't know their age and that just tells you that they don't keep track of their age and if they don't keep the track of age, obviously they were not celebrating their birthday. They were not being reminded that this was the day they were born. Because if they were remembering this, was the day they're born, they will not, they will actually remember the dates they were born and they will be able to calculate their age.
08:10:06

08:10:07

[Speaker 1]: So they don't really put much emphasis in birthday, then. Wow, the old people really missed a lot. So old people, I think that's true, actually, because I barely remember that when my grandmother died, we had to guess her age by estimate. It wasn't really her exact age that was written on the poster. So we have to go through her age mates to discover maybe the age, her age.
08:41:40

08:42:25

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
08:42:49

08:44:00

[Speaker 1]: So if you have kids, would you like to introduce them to birthday celebration?
08:49:26

08:51:07

[Speaker 2]: If I have kids, obviously.
08:52:34

08:52:47

[Speaker 1]: Are you, will you celebrate them just normal, happy birthday, like you were raised.
08:59:20

09:00:34

[Speaker 2]: To have a limit for the first few years of their life, I'll be celebrating a birthday, but, as they grow older, I think I'll dial down on the way I celebrate their birthday. You can just be happy, wish then and maybe send them money. If I'm capable, I'll be sending them money. Happy birthday, take this as your birthday gift, that kind of thing. But not to come and do a ceremony to celebrate a birthday. But it's very essential you do a ceremonious birthday for your kids in their first few years of life. Maybe their first birthday, second birthday, fifth birthday, 6th birthday. But as a grow older, the birthday ceremonies thing, you can dial it down the beach and just do like a small gifting to them just to remind them that you love them and make them feel special on their birthday.
09:47:27

09:47:50

[Speaker 1]: Okay? So what you're saying is that those early age of their life where they take pictures and all that, that is very necessary that you celebrate their birthday for them, at least for the sake of memory. Alright, Victor, I appreciate your input on this issue of birthday. So I believe to see you around again for more discussion. Thank you so much, Victor.
10:15:27

10:16:08

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, thank you very much.

[Speaker 2]: My name is Precious, and I consent to recording this conversation.
00:06:42

00:06:59

[Speaker 1]: Okay, so we'll be looking at heart diseases, and by way of introduction, we see that heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and its functions. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects, among others. Now, do you have anything to say about that?
00:29:34

00:30:05

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Heart disease is recently one of the sudden causes of death in our environment. And like you said, it ranges from diseases like myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, congenital defects as well, and usually a compendium of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels and have a ripple effect in the environment.
00:52:13

00:52:38

[Speaker 1]: Okay, true. Okay. So, going further, I would like to go into have an overview, rather, of some symptoms of heart diseases. And we see that symptoms can vary depending on the specific heart condition. But some common symptoms now could include chest pain, which is also known as angina, shortness of breath, fatigue or weakness, palpitations that's irregular or fast heartbeats, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea or indigestion. Do you have anything further to say about this?
01:27:19

01:27:27

[Speaker 2]: Okay, so, for the symptoms you just mentioned, it varies according to the heart condition. So, in some heart conditions, like congestive cardiac failure, you can see shortness of breath, also known as dyspnoea, where the individual finds it difficult to breathe in. And usually when there's the heart condition, it has an effect on the lungs and leads to pulmonary edema, where it obstructs and blocks the alveoli, so making breathing difficult. Also, the individual can notice fatigue or weakness and inability to do certain activities compared to before. Usually he will be able to run certain distances, but he will not be able to anymore. Those are also symptoms of cardiac diseases. Also, chest pain, like you mentioned, angina pectoris, where there's pain around the region of the chest can also be a presentation of cardiovascular diseases. Palpitations, which is irregular or fast heartbeats, can also present as heart, as cardiac conditions, you can have edema, which is what you know as swelling in the legs, where the person's leg, ankle, or feet can be swollen, it can be pitting or non-pitting edema. Also, nausea, vomiting, indigestion and dizziness, so to mention, but a few. These are some of the risks, and these are some of the symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.
02:48:09

02:48:18

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Alright. So, talking about risk factors for heart diseases, we see that they can be divided into modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Now, let's go into modifiable factors. We have high blood pressure, which is hypertension, high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress and poor mental health, and a whole lot of others. And then going into non-modifiable, we see age, we see family, we see gender, we see ethnicity. So, do you have anything about modifiable risk factors?
03:34:43

03:35:43

[Speaker 2]: Okay, for the modifiable risk factors, these are risk factors that change can be, can be affected.
03:45:02

03:45:37

[Speaker 1]: Yes.
03:45:53

03:46:02

[Speaker 2]: So, these risk factors are not, are not genetic, they are not inbuilt, you can do something about them. So, for example, smoking. So, smoking poses a very, very high-risk cardiovascular diseases. An individual who smokes is at risk of different cardiovascular diseases, like atherosclerosis, that will eventually lead to hypertension, that will lead to congestive cardiac failure. So, obesity is another risk factor. An individual who is overweight beyond normal for his age and weight is going to tend towards having cardiovascular complications. So also, someone who has a sedentary lifestyle, who has less of physical activity, who usually doesn't do much, can also pose a risk for cardiovascular disease. Someone who does not exercise, someone who consumes unhealthy diets, that consumes a lot of fully unsaturated fats, is also at risk of cardiovascular diseases. Someone with high cholesterol levels, too much intake of alcohol and stress, to mention but a few. All of these are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
04:53:15

04:53:29

[Speaker 1]: Okay, and how about the non-modifiable.
04:56:27

04:56:36

[Speaker 2]: Okay, for the non-modifiable risk factors. These risk factors, generally, these risk factors are in the individual and, for example, age. An individual who is older has a risk for more cardiovascular diseases because with age, the blood vessels become harder, there's thickening, there's fibrosis. This can predispose one to hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Also, a person who has a positive family history for a heart disease can also have a heart disease. For example, the father had myocardial infraction. He or she can also have myocardial infarction. For gender, usually men have a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases than female, and for some races, they are also predisposed to cardiovascular diseases.
05:45:19

05:45:28

[Speaker 1]: Alright, that's very, very true. So, let's talk about the prevention of heart diseases. So, we see that preventing heart disease now involves managing risk factors and making healthy lifestyle choices. So, talking about healthy diets, we see that person should consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats and should also limit intake of saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. And we also see in the aspect of stress, managing stress. A person should practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises. We also see regular health checks, checkups. Monitor your blood pressure consistently, cholesterol also and blood sugar levels regularly. Follow medical advice and take prescribed medications as directed. We also see avoid smoking and limit alcohol. Now, do you have anything to say about smoking? Like avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol?
06:56:52

06:57:40

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Yes. Yes. That is very, very, very important. That is very, very, very important. So, there's almost no benefit of smoking? Yes, smoking should be avoided, limit your alcohol intake, manage stress, go for regular health checkups to check your blood pressure and be sure that you are on track. And do make sure you stay hydrated, maintain a healthy body weight, get enough sleep, get enough rest as well.
07:32:04

07:32:24

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, that's true. Okay, so now i'll want to ask a question. So, what are some lifestyle changes that you have made to lower your risk of developing heart disease?
07:44:16

07:44:36

[Speaker 2]: Okay, so for lifestyle changes, things like exercise, exercising regularly and as often as possible. Yes. Also, good diets, healthy diets, reducing the level of junk and taking more fruits and vegetables can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Good rest, avoiding alcohol intake and smoking can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
08:04:52

08:13:08

[Speaker 1]: All true. Thank you so much.

[Speaker 2]: My name is Abdulraman and I consent to recording this conversation.
00:07:36

00:09:06

[Speaker 1]: So in our society today, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the hike in oil prices, in price of oil around the world and in our country today. So what do you think has been the biggest factor? What do you think are the causes that's contributed to the increase in oil prices?
00:36:40

00:37:14

[Speaker 2]: I think the number one cause that increased the petrol price in Nigeria for a case study is the removal of subsidy by the new government. And also there have been some conflicts between the oil producing states that has actually affected the production of oil and oil bunkering and a lot of factors like the oil bunkering now, there are some communities in Niger Delta for example, for instance, where this oil has been extracted from and these communities are not receiving even like palliative from the government which has caused them to cause, to bring up a resistance group. The resistance group is not like the Ijaw people resistance group where these people go to oil pipes and break oil pipes, take oil illegally, sell it in black market. And a lot of atrocities have been done by these people due to the inability of the government to at least give them some stipends. Because you are taking oil from their, from their environment, from their communities and you are causing more environmental pollutions without being compensating them, which is causing a lot of effects on their children. The waters there are so, so bad. The health issue, the health care, everything just going wrong for them in that, in that community. So how do you expect them not to form a resistance group or not to try and fight for their right, even though they might be fighting in the wrong manner. But still they have justifications for some of their cries and their plea to the government.
02:45:39

02:46:56

[Speaker 1]: And these issues lead to increase in oil prices because they lead to shortage of oil and they have to make profit. So the price of petroleum increased and another cause of the hike in fuel prices, international conflict as well, like the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, has led to an increase in crude oil per barrel that led to a rapid increase in crude oil per barrel and this affects the oil price as well because now the barrel is being sold for a higher price. So after the crude has been refined, they have to sell the petroleum products and other byproducts of the crude at a higher price. So this also is another cause of the hike in oil prices. And it has a lot of impact on the economy. So visible impact, so obvious impacts on the economy. If, because many countries like country Nigeria now depends our main source of revenue is from oil. So if the price of oil goes up, you expect all other things to follow. Because we are mainly dependent on oil. Dependent on oil for transportation, depend on oil as well for industries. So if the price goes up, all other parts of the economy will grow up too. And this one of the major effects is that it leads to increase in price of goods and services of products. Because manufacturers use fuel for their machines in industry and they have to now they are buying it at a higher price. So it affects the price of what they produce as well. And in all aspects, both in agriculture, in transport industry, the rate of transportation also increase. And due to the effects of the hike in oil price. And if I may ask, what has been your personal experience that I have encountered with the rising oil price? That you have encountered.
04:54:17

04:55:09

[Speaker 2]: Rising oil price especially in my country, Nigeria has really caused a lot of issue in terms of food. Like you go to the market today, you buy a particular commodity for a particular price. Then the next day the price increase or triple save in some cases due to the increment, increase in oil price. Because even our oil are being sold when we transport them that we have been. We transport them using dollar. And whenever the dollar goes up automatically, the oil price also goes, will go up. Which will have other effects on the. Our goods and services that we buy. Even regular trans transport also became. We will become very, very expensive. This um. All these increments already has caused a lot of increment in poverty in our community. Because you can't. There is no increment in salaries and everything is increasing. So there is hike in every goods. So it would be impossible for people to buy, that are collecting minimal salary to also buy goods.
06:23:14

06:24:15

[Speaker 1]: And the effect it has an enormous effect on people in rate of, like you talk about poverty, people are unable to afford people are getting poorer and the minimum wage has not been increased. So it makes people not to be able to afford the things they can buy before because the old price has increased. And I think some solutions that can be. That can be preferred is one. If they can resolve the conflict in all these countries are cause the increase of crude go up. If there can be less wars among nations, it will greatly reduce the price of oil. And even within the country as well, If conflict and within communities where crude are being extracted from. If they can come into a peaceful resolution, I think it also affects the price and it will bring it down. And also corruption as well. There's a high rate of corruption in our country that has cause the fuel price to increase because people are stealing fuel, and those are in government are secretly stealing the fuel, making it short and making the price to go high. So if you can address all these issues, I believe that, the fuel, the price, the hike in price of fuel will greatly reduce. I need to have a good effects on the economy. Things will be balanced, and people will be able to afford the common things that they could afford before.

00:12:08

[Speaker 2]: Thank you.
00:12:34

00:13:05

[Speaker 1]: So our topic today is child marriage. And over the years, child marriage is a widespread social and human rights issue where individuals below the age of 18 are married, often without their consent. And this practice, it affects girls who are forced into marriage before their physical, mental and emotional maturity. So what do you know about child marriage in this part of the world?
00:36:47

00:37:12

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Generally, I believe child marriage should actually be termed a life threatener because I believe it stresses the life of children. It stresses their well being. There is a joy in expressing childhood, and I believe through child marriage that cannot be achieved. So it actually aborts the future of people. Yes, child children in particular.
01:03:59

01:03:15

[Speaker 1]: That's very true. So I read an article about child marriage in certain parts of the world still being a common practice even in the northern part of Nigeria. It's still a very common practice in northern part of Nigeria. What are your thoughts on this issue?
01:15:39

01:16:09

[Speaker 2]: I believe in the northern part of Nigeria, to be specific, although I would say that is not, the only part, that is the only tribe per se, that is only performing the act. But I believe that's where it is most common. And I think it's something that has been. That people have been. People of influence have been trying to curb. They have been trying to put an end to it. But this is something that has been ingrained deep in their culture and in their tribe, and I believe issue, and I believe it will take a long while for it to actually be. I don't even believe it can be completely eradicated. But I believe with education, health education, with acknowledging that, okay, these are the repercussions, these are the consequences. These are the even health related issues that can come from it, then I believe we should be able to work better on it.
02:11:31

02:13:25

[Speaker 1]: Oh, that's a very good point of view. So this child marriage affects people because it denies them of their chance to education, their health, and even development. How do you think child marriage can affect a young child, a young girl, for instance?
02:29:00

02:30:24

[Speaker 2]: Okay, the first thing is, I believe it's, let's talk about the body generally, or the feeling it's lower self esteem, because that is mostly gender inequality. If you are talking about child, you don't see a is, let's say a 15 boy, a 15 year old boy or a 14 year old boy getting married. They would definitely put him into work, maybe to learn work or to work on farms or something like that. But when it comes to female, you see 12, 13, 14 getting married already. So I believe that that is gender inequality and will lower children's self esteem. Then apart from that, there are practices that children shouldn't even be aware of yet, like sex. That is something. Child shouldn't have a full knowledge of what it entails. And I believe child marriage, we put the children at the forefront of experiencing and participating in sex, even against their consent. So. And I believe it's also robbed girls of their childhood and it threatens their well being. This is, there's something called. So this is a very prominent and a very prominent health issue that deals with child marriage, especially girls. And this is very prominent among girls of that experience. Child Yes, child marriage. So. And they become pregnant at some points. There are lots of pregnancy weeks that also comes in place because they are just so young, their body is not ready for it. So that is what I believe
04:02:09

04:02:03

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is true. And just like you said, it will lower their self esteem and expose. Expose them to harmful levels of domestic violence and abuse and also a violation of human rights, just like you said.
04:13:30

04:13:30

[Speaker 2]: It also takes a heavy toll on their mental health, because even people that are old and they are giving birth, they have post, there's something called postpartum after birth. So they experience postpartum depression, postpartum bipolar disorder, a lot of things like that. So imagine if a younger person is now experiencing all those at the same time with other health issues. I believe that could actually kill a child. So we can. We can just say child marriage is a killer of this thing.
04:43:45

04:44:17

[Speaker 1]: That is true. And generally, or should I say globally, efforts have been made to end child marriage and protect the rights of children to save an healthy childhood. So what do you think we can do as a country to prevent child marriage or protect the rights of these children?
05:01:37

05:01:57

[Speaker 2]: Okay. To reiterate what I already said in the previous conversation. So in the beginning of the conversation. So I will say they should, they really need to educate. Okay. I know it's not easy, because some people are so embedded in their culture, in their tradition and say I want to make my culture proud. I want to elevate my culture and things like that. So. But I believe with health education, with not only health education, with telling them the repercussions of this thing, with them saying it with their eyes, and not just keeping those children and stigmatizing them, bring them out. This is what has happened to this person. This is what has happened to this person. Let us learn from it. Let us desert from these things. So I believe it should also work and people should. I believe the law should also take a part in this. There should be a law side or there should be a law that. Okay. If there's anybody that is giving his or her child and in marriage and the child is less than 21, I believe there should be a court of law that goes against that or that punishes those offenders, just like how we have sex offenders.
06:05:14

[Speaker 2]: My name is Wang Cholom and I consent to this recording.
00:07:33

00:07:51

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. So, rape, big topic for our society. Big, big topic. So what's your point of view about rape?
00:18:59

00:18:56

[Speaker 2]: I see rape as a very bad and heinous crime. I see it as something that sets the society ablaze to me.
00:30:38

00:31:14

[Speaker 1]: Okay.
00:31:28

00:31:38

[Speaker 2]: If anyone hears of an, of a case of rape or is accused of rape, the person is viewed as a very bad person and is already judged by society before being judged in court or any other place.
00:48:16

00:48:24

[Speaker 1]: Okay?
00:48:58

00:49:12

[Speaker 2]: Yes. And it's a bad crime such that some people take matters into their hands. You can take the life of people accused of. It's a very bad and societal threatening crime.
01:07:20

01:07:44

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Personally, my opinion about rape is rape rape, as you said is so bad because it does so much trauma, especially to the victims, not just sexually, but psychologically. Most people, be it male or female, you know, they come out with cases of PTSD. Even after years of therapy, you know, they are still having that post traumatic like syndrome kind of stuff. So I see rape as very, very bad. But on your own, on your own, your own view, personally, do you think society is favoring rape in the sense of dress manner, in the sense of parental instructions, in the sense of religious bodies? Do you think we are favoring it or the things they are doing at those particular fronts are reducing the incidence of rape?
02:14:22

02:14:54

[Speaker 2]: I don't think what we're doing presently as a society, community and individually is bringing down or stepping down the issue of rape. I feel like it's increasing it and boosting it. Societies begin to accept dress codes that are so seductive and it permits all kind of things, like people can go out however they choose to walk around the streets and then if someone, you'll expect that other people will have self-control, and I don't think it's right. I don't think it's, I don't think society is trying because society is actually promoting this thing and they are calling it fashion.
03:10:03

03:10:11

[Speaker 1]: Fashion show.
03:10:53

03:11:08

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. Because like, let me give you an example. I saw a piece of, let me just say like waistband strap of a jeans that is being sold as a full clothing.
03:23:50

03:25:16

[Speaker 1]: So, you see, and girls these days, they just.
03:29:29

03:29:30

[Speaker 1]: They go for that.
03:30:11

03:31:57

[Speaker 2]: They just go around.
03:32:21

03:32:48

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
03:34:36

03:34:56

[Speaker 2]: Opening their backs up and not knowing or thinking that, okay, this might arouse.
03:42:04

03:42:40

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
03:43:58

03:43:59

[Speaker 2]: Someone's interest.
03:44:10

03:44:20

[Speaker 1]: Sure.
03:44:36

03:45:12

[Speaker 2]: So, society isn't helping, not one bit. And it has gone from not being there to bad to worse.
03:57:25

03:57:39

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
03:57:55

03:58:37

[Speaker 2]: And I don't know what's next to.
04:01:01

04:01:30

[Speaker 1]: Be worst, I guess. Yes.
04:04:37

04:05:39

[Speaker 2]: And the generation, present generation, coming in has the trend of doing it and still, when maybe someone takes a look at them, they harass you. Like, have you never seen someone dress before? The community supports them. But when such a person is said to be raped? No, they don't look like, okay, this person has been indecently dressed for a while. They just go ahead and say, why did this person do it?
04:44:05

04:44:18

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
04:44:39

04:45:00

[Speaker 2]: Without thinking that probably that person has been pushed. And you never know. Most rape cases are not cases that just happen. Maybe outside, maybe you get to hear that the person paid an opposite sex a visit, and people don't end up asking what actually happened. So, society doesn't help at all.
05:13:36

05:14:11

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, talking about society, I had this, in my experience, where I think I was around the junction, and I saw. I saw a lady, and an elderly woman was trying to, like, you know, correct her and dress good. And it was in an appropriate manner. You know, the manner of correction also matters. There are people that can just see, I'm like, You know, stuff like that. But she was correcting this lady a lovely manner, in a motherly manner. And just for the lady to, you know, speak very bad at this woman, telling her all sort of stuff like, it's my body, you didn't buy the clothes for me. You know, stuff like that. So, if this person, for instance, now falls victim of rape, and it's within the neighboring community, and that woman, per venture, is in the presence of the crime scene, she has no say. Because when I was giving you that advice, you were, you were adamant about your own point of view on the way you were dressed. So, it's a big thing. I think it needs to be corrected from the home front. As the saying goes, charity begins from home. Once parents can tell their children, this is it, this is that. There's no doubt about it that the minds of some people are perverted. Whether you wear a big clothes or you cover everywhere, there are just still some people that will look at you and feel sexually aroused by your outfit. But at least something should be done on the home front or in the home front, rather, to see that we put ethics, especially dressing, dressing ethics. Yeah, put dressing ethics. Inculcate it in the minds of young people. And, you know, I feel like it will go a long way to reduce rape cases or rape incidents in the society. And secondly, I don't know, what's your point of view concerning the media, be it social media, the media.
07:29:08

07:30:15

[Speaker 2]: It's actually worse than the physical society, social media doesn't help at all. Like, for social media, I would say it's very terrible, extremely terrible. You go online, you try to click on a site, and you get to notice that a lot of pop ups that pop up these days are sexual pop ups, almost on every site, even clean sites you want to go in. Maybe you want to download something simple, video for work or something. They keep popping ads for you. Apart from that, you go online, especially for the youth of this age.
08:17:16

08:17:33

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
08:17:48

08:18:12

[Speaker 2]: The so-called Gen Z. It means that their parents can't control what the view online. You go to virtually any site, you go to their own social media. Good.
08:32:33

08:32:41

[Speaker 1]: Even cartoons.
08:33:30

08:34:10

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
08:34:45

08:35:01

[Speaker 1]: For the younger generations. Yeah.
08:37:00

08:37:01

[Speaker 2]: Something else.
08:37:46

08:38:34

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
08:38:17

08:38:42

[Speaker 2]: I once saw a cartoon, well, my friend, she once watched, started watching a cartoon. Actually, it's her kids thinking it was a cartoon. I don't know if I'm permitted to name the name of the cartoon.
08:51:19

08:51:56

[Speaker 1]: Sure, you are.
08:51:48

08:52:57

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, but, okay, like cartoon, like sausage party or American dad, they're all sexually induced, like. So social media doesn't help you. They go online, they can watch all these things. As a parent, you might say, okay, don't watch those programs, don't watch that one. But they go online. They can download it. They can download Netflix on their phone, watch these things. They can go on WhatsApp and share pictures with each other.
09:21:05

09:21:12

[Speaker 1]: Sure.
09:21:35

09:22:46

[Speaker 2]: They can go on Facebook and watch porn for free. Go on Twitter and see the same thing. And some sites might be like, yeah. Hope you're 18 and even if you're not 18.
09:37:23

09:37:29

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Just click and yes, sure.
09:39:49

09:40:06

[Speaker 2]: And nothing happens because there's no means for proper verification.
09:44:46

09:45:53

[Speaker 1]: Sure, sure.
09:45:39

09:46:54

[Speaker 2]: There's no luck and there's no prevention because these sites too, like all over the site, pay for rights for ads and all that. So, the online community, to me, is what start it.
09:59:04

10:00:58

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. So social media is a kind of negative role.
10:04:24

10:05:31

[Speaker 2]: An extremely negative. Kids don't go online anymore to study.
10:10:47

10:11:02

[Speaker 1]: Sure.
10:11:30

10:12:35

[Speaker 2]: Once they study and they just divert to go and look for one or two more interesting things, and they end up getting distracted with all these things from the net.
10:23:56

10:23:23

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.
10:23:40

10:24:10

[Speaker 2]: Tomorrow you see them voting and shouting for role models that are not actually role models.
10:36:57

10:36:04

[Speaker 1]: Role models, sure.
10:37:43

10:38:03

[Speaker 2]: People that dress, indecently.
10:44:19

10:49:03

[Speaker 1]: That I just feel like if we were to compare, like, the incidents of rape way before and now I think it's on the rising. Do you agree with that?
11:00:44

11:01:54

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, I agree with that. I actually do agree with that.
11:04:25

11:04:25

[Speaker 1]: And for me personally, I think it's because of the advent of social media, because of the advent of, you know, exposure, exposure. People we don't call, we don't cope. We don't cope. The screen, there's this thing DStv started doing, I think some years back that there is parental guide, you can lock some certain channels, you know, for your kids not to have access. And I think it's one way that we can use social media and still use it effectively, effectively, rather to curb all these screen exposures and stuff like that. So have you had anyone like directly been a victim of it or have you been a victim of rape?
12:01:25

12:01:33

[Speaker 2]: No.
12:01:47

12:02:07

[Speaker 1]: Because men are also abused.
12:03:32

12:04:13

[Speaker 2]: Yeah, men are also abused. I believe that men don't even come out to say it because, because they feel like they are manly. They come out to say it.
12:14:00

12:14:43

[Speaker 1]: It's a shameful thing in society.
12:16:21

12:17:58

[Speaker 2]: It's a shameful thing in the society. A lot of men just keep it to themselves and end up with it, trying to be manly and all that. But men to are victims of rape.
12:36:12

12:36:33

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, yeah. I had a friend back in the university and he told me he had an aunt that raped him as early as age, was he age ten or twelve? And, you know, each time he's going through a phase in life, he just thinks about that and kind of affects his mental health. So, these are some of the issues that rape does to someone or to a person. So, I just feel like society should put more measures, especially on social media and the family front. Let parents be intentional about what their kids watch. Let parents be intentional about the friends their kids keep, because peer pressure is something that affects people that are growing up. And one thing again, is.
13:33:12

13:33:28

[Speaker 2]: They should also, be intentional about what their kids wear.
13:36:14

13:36:27

[Speaker 1]: Wear, exactly.
13:37:36

13:41:03

[Speaker 2]: Their kids, everything. Especially young girls.
13:44:32

13:44:43

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, sure, sure. And to the younger girls also, and the guys, young guys, young girls, there should be sensation about. Yeah, we know you're just getting to your prime, but life just begins here. And for you to be at the end of exposure and exposing dresses, it only makes your life that is just beginning to end at that point because you could, you could be a victim of rape. You know, there are many things, STD's, what have you, that you could have, through rape, and stuff like that. So there should be more orientation. There should be more orientation on detrimental issues of it, and I think the society will get better bit by bit if we do that.

00:13:13

[Speaker 1]: Thank you Mr Kelonzo for agreeing to be with us today on board.
00:17:13

00:18:12

[Speaker 2]: You are welcome.
00:19:12

00:19:49

[Speaker 1]: On today's discussion, we'll be talking about good leadership. And before we dive in, I would like you to tell us what is good leadership?
00:28:57

00:31:00

[Speaker 2]: Good leadership is the ability to guide, inspire and motivate others towards achieving a common goal. It involves effective communication, problem solving, decision making and vision setting. A good leader leads by example, listens and values the opinions of their team, and promotes a positive work culture. They possess strong emotional intelligence, adaptability and resilience to navigate through challenges and drive success.
01:12:34


01:14:10

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much. That will help us know more about good leadership. Now, what qualities make a good leader? Rather, Mr Motua
01:24:31


01:26:51

[Speaker 2]: We have several qualities that make a good leader. If we may start with number one, integrity. Whereby we will say integrity is the cornerstone of trust in leadership. And a good leader must possess unwavering integrity to inspire confidence and maintain credibility. When leaders consistently uphold their values and principles, they set a moral compass for their teams, fostering an environment of honesty and dependability. Number 2, we have innovation. Innovation is virtue for staying competitive and driven, driving progress. Good leaders encourage innovation by valuing new ideas and creating creative problem solving. They recognize that embracing change is essential to adapt and thrive in constantly evolving world. Number 3, we have vision. A leader's vision provides direction and I purpose for their team. It creates a shared goal that motivates and guides everyone toward a common objective. A leader with a clear vision can inspire and align their team's efforts toward achieving ambitious goals. Number 4, passion. Passion fuels dedication and perseverance. Good leaders are passionate about their work and vision, which motivates them and inspires others to give their best. This enthusiasm can drive a team to overcome obstacles and achieve greatness. Number 5, we have communication. Effective communication is a linchpin of leadership. Leaders must articulate their vision, provide guidance and listen actively to their team. Strong communication skills ensure that messages are understood, fostering collaboration and trust. Number 6, we have self awareness. Self awareness. Leaders understand their strengths and weaknesses. This awareness enables them to make informed decision, leverage their strength and work on areas that need improvement. It also allows them to relate better to their team members. Another one is empathy at number 7, empathy is the ability to understand and connect with others emotionally. Good leaders use empathy to build rapport, resolve conflicts and create a supportive and inclusive work environment. It shows team members that the leaders cares about their well being. Number 8, we have courage. Leadership often requires making tough decisions and facing challenges. And on courageous, leaders are willing to take calculated risks, stand up for their beliefs and confront difficulties. Situation which even when uncomfortable. Number 9, we have delegation. Effective delegation is a mark of a confidence and capable leader. By entrusting tasks to team members based on their strengths and skills, leaders empower their team to take ownership and develop their abilities. This frees a leader to focus on strategic aspects of their role. Number 10, learning agility. In rapidly changing world, leaders must be quick learners. Learning agility allows leaders to adapt new information and circumstances, continuously improving decision making and problem solving abilities. Number eleven, we have adaptability. Adaptability. Leaders must adapt to involving situation and challenges. Those who can embrace change and adjust their strategies accordingly are better equipped to lead their teams through uncertainty. And ambiguity. 12, we have decision making. In leadership, decision making isn't just a task, it's a pivotal skill. Effective leaders don't make choices on a whim. They thoughtfully align each decision with their border vision and goals. They seek diverse opinion carefully with the pros and cons, then choose a course of action with conviction. This meticulous approach not only drives their objective forward, but also builds trust and respect among team members, reinforcing their leader's role as trusted guide. Number 13, we have accountability. Accountability means taking responsibility for one's action and decision. When leaders hold themselves accountable, they set a standard of responsibility for their team, fostering a culture of ownership and reliability. Number 14, we have gratitude. In a leadership role, expressing gratitude goes far beyond simple courtesy. It serves as an acknowledgement of hard work and contributions of team members. This practice not only boosts morale, but also strengthens interpersonal relationships and fosters a positive work environment. Such an unmote becomes a catalyst for motivation and productivity. Reinforcing the leaders role is an uplifting and empowering presence. Number 15, we have influence. Influence or influential leaders inspire others to follow their lead willingly. They lead by example, creating a shared sense of purpose and commitment within the team. Their influence stems from their character, action and ability to connect with others. And the last one, and not the least, is respect. Respect for all team members, regardless of their role or background, is essential for creating a humorous and inclusive workplace. Leaders who demonstrate respect foster a culture of collaboration and mutual support, enabling everyone to thrive.
09:03:22

09:04:57

[Speaker 1]: Well, thank you very much for that. And on to our next question. How have you seen them demonstrated in your personal or professional experience?
09:14:08

09:15:18

[Speaker 2]: Where I used to work, our leader would communicate on time, on making adjustments to schedules and budgets.
09:26:06

09:26:30

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much for that. And without wasting time, I would like us to proceed with the next question. Where, in your opinion, do you think leadership is something that can be learnt or is it an innate trait?
09:42:39

09:44:01

[Speaker 2]: Leadership is an invaluable asset for any organization and it can be learned. Education and training provide individuals with knowledge and skills that can help them become effective leaders. Through education and training, individuals gain the ability to recognize their strengths and weaknesses.
10:08:26

10:08:26

[Speaker 1]: Wow. And final, but not the last one, have you ever had a mentor or seen someone develop their leadership skills over time?
10:17:37

10:18:06

[Speaker 2]: Yes, I once worked in a credit company and in such companies you need a lot of patient, agility, awareness, passion and . My mentor really lacked those skills due to impatient, poor communication, education and anger issues. But with time he has really improved. At the moment, as we speak, he is at the forefront to educate and create awareness in good leadership skills.
10:57:17

10:58:58

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much for your time. We are really grateful for that and we look forward to having you again.
11:06:11

[Speaker 2]: I am a Manchester United supporter.

00:27:47

00:30:45

[Speaker 2]: Yes.

00:32:06

[Speaker 1]: Mister Ruben, could you kindly tell us more about Manchester United before we dive into our questions?
00:37:24

00:38:24

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Manchester United is a professional football club based in Manchester, England. Founded in 1878, it is one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in the world. The team has a rich history and a large global fanbase. With its home ground at Old Trafford Stadium, Manchester United has won numerous domestic and international titles, including 20 English league titles and three European clubs. The club is known for its iconic red and white jersey and has a sport marking it on mostly renowned and prestigious football clubs in the world.
01:22:18

01:23:30

[Speaker 1]: Wow. That's very rich of Manchester United. Now, I want us to dive in our questions. Did you watch or did you catch Manchester United's game last weekend?
01:34:51

01:35:15

[Speaker 2]: Yes, I did.
01:36:24

01:36:50

[Speaker 1]: And what did you think of their performance?
01:39:13

01:40:52

[Speaker 2]: I watched the match between Manchester United and Liverpool. I am a Manchester United fan. What an entertaining match. Manchester United were playing at their home ground, commonly known as Old Strafford. The first half they faced up defeat with Liverpool taking a lead by one. The Manchester United defence was in shambles and they lacked possession of the ball. The possession was also in favour of Liverpool with a percentage of 43% and 57%, with Manchester United lacking a shot on target, while Liverpool enjoying a total of 15 shots and four shots on target. We had three offside decisions and one yellow card from Liverpool's side. Two big chances wasted by Liverpool with several possessions lost by both teams. The second half was a much entertaining as the host Manchester United came from behind to a two one win up to the 84th minute when Mohamed Salah rescued Liverpool and the match ended in a two-two draw. The overall performance we had seven yellow cards, with Manchester United grabbing five yellow cards and Liverpool two yellow cards. We saw young players representing both teams as young as 18 years. Kobbie Mainoo played really well and he was forced out of pitch due to injury on the 85th minute, Manchester United keeper Andre Onana displayed a good performance by saving three crucial saves against Liverpool. The man of the match was Bruno Fernandes, the captain of Manchester United. The players on scoresheet were Bruno Fernandez and Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United, while on the other side of Liverpool, Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah scored the goals.
04:08:59

04:09:21

[Speaker 1]: Wow. And I'm really excited to see how Mister Mose, I'm really excited to see how Manchester United will do in the upcoming season. So what player are you most looking forward to watching on the team?
04:25:04

04:26:10

[Speaker 2]: I think the team is now working hard and focusing on winning trophies. The goal of the team is to take the club to the next level and play in European Championship or competitions. I'm looking forward watching Kobbie Mainoo play because right now he is performing very well and is trying hard and working very hard to make sure that the team gets positive results. I'm also looking forward to see the captain, Bruno Fernandes unite players on pitch and bring the atmosphere of positive energy in both the pitch and dressing room. I'm also betting on Garnacho to improve and get more goals and work on being the top scorer on the sheet. And lastly, I want to see the performance of Amad Diallo who we want to see him play as he did on his performance while he was at loan at Sunderland. He will for sure be a great bet. We also want to encourage the coach, Erik ten Hag to rotate the squad so that we can see more positive results on the pitch.
05:50:23

05:51:07

[Speaker 1]: That was very educative about Manchester United and you almost made me come and to shift from my team. Actually, I'll think about that, but I'm so grateful for the insight, Mr. Mose.

[Speaker 2]: And I am retabila Apani. I am giving consent to recording this conversation.
00:10:30

00:11:19

[Speaker 1]: All right, so today's topic is child marriage.
00:15:34

00:16:33

[Speaker 2]: Yo, that's a toughie.
00:18:02

00:18:33

[Speaker 1]: That's a tough one. Yeah. So child marriage, it was described as a harmful practice that refers to any formal marriage. Right. Or informal union between a child under the ages of 18 and an adult or another child, you know. So this is basically a forced marriage...
00:49:45

00:49:45

[Speaker 2]: it is 
00:50:46

00:50:46

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. If you come to think of it, because a child under the age of 18, they are still developing. Now, how can you take that infant and throw them to an adult in a marriage? I mean, marriage is a very hard task. It's very hard itself.
01:16:25

01:17:20

[Speaker 2]: Imagine being a child having to, like, do those tasks. 
01:22:57

01:22:57

[Speaker 1]: Imagine
01:23:39

01:23:39

[Speaker 2]: ...that old women can't even obtain.
01:26:21

01:26:43

[Speaker 1]: No, they can't. You know, they can't. So I feel that it's child abuse, but however, it's actually being practiced in other cultures. So in other people, it's a culture, you know, whereby you get a child, a girl child at the ages of maybe 10, 12, 14, being married to an old man.
02:03:02

02:03:40

[Speaker 2]:  Older than their father
02:05:09

02:05:09

[Speaker 1]: Older than their fathers, their grandfathers. I actually came across this video On Facebook where a granny married a child.
02:22:27


02:23:56

[Speaker 2]: How is that even possible? who does that?
02:26:39

02:25:28

[Speaker 1]: Married a child, a seven year old boy. I don't know if I still have that picture, but I took a screenshot of it. I was so moved, you know, I was so moved. I was so emotional. Like, you know, it goes back to that issue of naming children with dead people. You know, other. Other people name their kids by maybe their dead grandmother, dead grandfather, whoever. Now it destroys them, I feel that.
03:05:53

03:05:53

[Speaker 2]:  Yeah, those kids must be going through a lot.
03:08:05

03:08:24

[Speaker 1]: They are.
03:09:03

03:10:01

[Speaker 2]: Imagine at the age of 10 to 18, you must still be playing
03:16:00

03:16:45

[Speaker 1]: You must still be playing 
03:18:10

03:18:52

[Speaker 2]: with toys.
03:19:27

03:20:08

[Speaker 1]: You know, 
03:20:16

03:21:20

[Speaker 2]: getting, like, jumping muddy puddles.
03:23:56

03:24:18

[Speaker 1]: Trying to find yourself.
03:25:48

03:26:11

[Speaker 2]: Yes, but being a wife or a husband at that age.
03:30:33

03:29:36

[Speaker 1]: At that age, wow!
03:31:55

03:31:35

[Speaker 2]:  That must be terrifying. 
03:32:37

03:33:00

[Speaker 1]:  Its very terrifying, it's Terrible.  You know, so I really do not agree with this but it's happening in some cultures, so whether we like it or not, it's happening. But then I would say that child marriage, it's an abuse to kids.
03:49:40

03:49:46

[Speaker 2]: It is.
03:51:22

03:51:42

[Speaker 1]: It's an abuse. You know, as you said, that, you know, a. A 16 year old, a teenager, like, let's just take a teenager for this instance. Those guys are still trying to find themselves.
04:08:13

04:07:40

[Speaker 2]: Themselves, Yes.
04:09:57

04:09:57

[Speaker 1]: Teenagers don't know anything about themselves. Hence we have so many sections, you know, about teenagers. Everywhere we go, we have books. We have books to help us raise teenagers. We have programs that we sign into to raise teenagers. You know, we do not get along with our teenage children. So imagine that kind of a child being placed in a marriage, you know, even if it's not a child and an adult, sometimes you find that it's actually two kids.
04:51:28

04:51:28

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
04:52:10

04:53:08

[Speaker 1]: You being married, maybe this one is twelve, that one is six.
04:56:47

04:57:36

[Speaker 2]: What happened to getting married because you love each other.
05:01:29

05:02:29

[Speaker 1]: Hence, I'm saying that sometimes, it is the culture
05:05:36

05:04:56

[Speaker 2]: Dont you think  that, when you're talking about the culture, don't you think it's because of poverty and stuff.
05:15:33

05:17:58

[Speaker 1]: You know In indian culture, we've see. Have you not seen it in indian cultures? Mostly 
05:24:20

05:24:20

[Speaker 2]: I have, 
05:25:58

05:25:58

[Speaker 1]: Yes. And you find that even the bride or the groom, they are unhappy. 
05:29:30


05:30:32

[Speaker 2]: Always 
05:31:13

05:31:23

[Speaker 1]: They are unhappy. 
05:32:41

05:32:27

[Speaker 2]:They are always unhappy
05:33:42


05:33:42

[Speaker 1]: And you find that maybe the girl's parents, the mother's not happy, she keeps crying. And the father is just there being bold and saying, you're gonna do this. You're gonna do this.
05:45:43

05:47:22

[Speaker 2]: So do you think it's because of poverty or.
05:49:48

05:52:20

[Speaker 1]: That kind of culture? I believe that it's poverty. I mean, you can. You cannot send your child to something that you know, that he or she will never handle. I feel that it's because of poverty. Parents sell their kids. Well, that's my opinion. You know?  that's my opinion. I feel that parents sell kids for poverty.
06:16:58

06:18:00

[Speaker 2]: Or maybe they're just looking out for their children to get a better future or I don't know.
06:24:09

06:24:09

[Speaker 1]: And you find that most of the time, even if that's the case, of maybe assisting your kid to get the privileges of a good life, those people, they are so abusive. The rich people are so abusive. They will abuse your kids until your child dies or maybe comes to you crying. 
06:43:47

06:43:47

[Speaker 2]: That's bad
06:45:03

06:45:03

[Speaker 1]: It's very bad.
06:46:57

06:46:57

[Speaker 2]: The worst part is they cannot even go back home.
06:48:21

06:48:50

[Speaker 1]: No, they cannot. I do not agree with that I'm telling you.

00:13:37

[Speaker 1]: Mary Muihaki, welcome to our today's program.
00:15:57

00:17:45

[Speaker 2]: I'm so much humbled to be with you on board today.
00:20:23

00:20:23

[Speaker 1]: Okay, today we are discussing about teenage pregnancy. Kindly let us know what is teenage pregnancy?
00:30:24

00:30:24

[Speaker 2]: Thank you very much and I will give a brief of what is teenage pregnancy? According to my understanding now, teenage pregnancy refers to the situation in which a girl aged between 13 and 19 becomes pregnant. It is a global issue that affects not only the pregnant girl but also her family as well as the community. Teenage pregnancy can have negative consequences for both the mother and child, including health risks, socio stigmatization and barrier to education and employment opportunities. Addressing this issue requires comprehensive sex education, access to reproductive healthcare and support for young parents.
01:21:13

01:23:26

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you for that brief explanation. And to our first question, did you hear about the recent rise in teenage pregnancies?
01:32:25

01:32:25

[Speaker 2]: Yes, and that made me feel so heartbroken.
01:36:29

01:38:10

[Speaker 1]: What do you think could be the reason behind it? 
01:41:50

01:43:50

[Speaker 2]: Now some of the causes of the high rise of the teenage pregnancy when we have school dropouts, pregnant girls often drop out of schools, limiting opportunities for future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Now we also have married adolescents. In this case, adolescent pregnancy can also have negative social and economic effects on girls. Their families and communities will be affected by this. We have socioeconomics, in this case for girls aged 15 to 19 years old, risks are associated with more socioeconomic factors that with the biological effects of age. These factors are critical in fully understanding teenage pregnancy and for promotion of reproductive health among the adolescents. We also have educational attainment, poor educational background, living non relatives, risky sexual behaviors, perceived support from parents, poor knowledge of sexuality are risk factors to considering high rises of teenage pregnancy. We also have media exposure. It is important to note that media exposure is a complex issue also in Nigeria and can have both positive and negative impacts on adolescents. Or we have other family members. In this case, teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sister of a teen mother are highly we can say that are highly exposed to becoming pregnant because they'll follow the suit of what the sister went through. We have parental support in this case. It is important to note that parental support can play a protective role in reducing adolescent pregnancy. So if a parent does not support their children, they will be exposed to what to most of what is going on, rather causing teenage pregnancy. We also have peer pressure, peer pressure and media influence. Aside from sexual or rather, sexual related abuse studies have reported that peer pressure is a significant factor influencing adolescent pregnancy, more so in the parts of Nigeria. We also have sexual violence. Early sexual debut and being out of school are significantly associated with teenage pregnancies. Desire to compensate for the loss of a child, reduced access to information and contraception, and increased sexual violence. This really rather increases the high rise of teenage pregnancies. We have lack of sex education. Those who have received minimal education are five times more likely to become a mother than those with higher levels of education. We have lack of contraceptions, lack of reproductive health education, lack of parental control, family and peer pressure, poverty, love for material goods, misinformation and also lack of individual agency. Poverty, school dropout, lack of community support and limited access to contraception rather are some of the high causes of teenage pregnancies. We have poverty. Poverty. Besides the lack of contraceptives, adolescent pregnancies are also fueled by poverty. A poverty and dysfunctional family are implicated as influencing adolescent pregnancy. More so in Ghana, we have alcohol or drug use. In this case, inhibition reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity causing teenage pregnancies. We also have early puberty alleviate. In this case, girls who mature early are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age and this will end up causing high rise in teenage pregnancies.
06:35:12

06:37:55

[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you for that information. Number two, I read an article about the challenges that teen teenage mothers rather face. Have you or anyone you know experienced similar struggles as a young parent?
06:57:12

06:58:36

[Speaker 2]: Yes, someone very close indeed faced some of the struggles and I would like to highlight some of the struggles that I've seen teenage mothers go through. If you kindly allow me Mister Francis. Challenge number one, we have changes to mental health. Both becoming a teenage and pregnant are among the risk factors for depression. When these two factors are combined, the risk increases. Only ten to 15% of older mother experience prenatal and postpartum. This is after delivery depression and there are several causes for mental health changes in teenage mothers. One reason is that teen moms are more likely to experience pregnancy complications and this added rather adds stress to the teen mother. Teen parents do not have the time to devote to exercise, sleep and self care that they may have had before giving birth. Another challenge we have is the cost of raising a child. Infant care comes with large costs as we all know about time involved in feeding a baby takes a lot and consumes a lot. It's important to know the financial investment involved as well. If you use formula, for example, you'll have to budget for this expense. Baby food, which most children begin at six months, is another cost to consider. New moms have bottles, diapers, clothes, and toys to consider. In addition to healthcare costs, an infant requires larger ticket items such as a crib, high chair, changing table, and a stroller. We also have another challenge is difficulty juggling school with a child. School, as we all know, is time consuming. High school students in most schools, they spend roughly 7 hours a day. Even more high school teachers nationwide assign three, let's say 3.5 hours of work, that is, assignments on average. That means that students taking five academic classes have roughly 10 hours of school related work each day. Of course, this number doesn't include time for other essential tasks like getting ready for the day and traveling to and from school. Taking care of an infant is time consuming as well. The average infant nurses eight to twelve times a day for 20 to 45 minutes. That's over 2 hours spent feeding each day. In addition, new mothers report exhaustion from waking up multiple times each night, changing, bathing the baby, playing with the child, all take significant time as well. With all these activities, most new moms have difficulty concentrating and finding time to rest, let alone do their homework. Another challenge we have is poverty. Teen mothers suffer from poverty. They resort to transactional sex or endure gender violence and abuse in exchange for material goods, food or money. Many of these young girls, they are younger than the fathers of their babies. Thus a huge power imbalance, making it difficult for poor teenage mothers to defend and protect themselves from abusers. Some end up opting for early marriages, a way of assessing food, clothing, housing and security, which is very sad. Mental health problems I'll have to repeat on this and explain more. We have several factors that can negatively affect her teens mother's mental health. These include lack of sufficient sleep, lack of family support, especially in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardians' home, change in social status, loss of friends, the cost of raising a child, and the hassle of juggling school or raising a child. This and others can lead to mental health problems, including stress and depression. We have the possibility of family conflict. Telling your parents that you are pregnant isn't easy at all. Many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant. In the worst case scenario, parents have kicked their pregnant daughters out of the house without any support. We also have change in social status. Teen mothers often experienced a vast change in their social lives. Some drop out of schools to devote time to raising their children. Others may stay in school but must drop extracurricular activities to find a job to support their child's needs. All of these courses are disconnected from previous social circles and some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning, but their friendship change as the new mother's focus changes. There are a lot of them, but I don't know if time allows us to continue with some. Maybe I can read one more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education. Girls lose their childhood and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their children whereby you see in Kenya, 98% of teen mothers are out of school with a zero probability of returning. We have stigma and rejection. Teen mothers face stigma from their parents, actually teachers, peers and society. This has made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times many are disowned by their parents or kicked out of home. This leaves them with more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community. So let's show them love, support, care as many times as we can. Thank you very much Mister Francis.
13:14:56

13:15:29

[Speaker 1]: Thank you so much for that. That was so informative. At least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers face through when they get their kids in early age. Thank you for coming through and thank you for having you.
13:29:34

13:31:46

[Speaker 2]: I'm so much humbled for having your time actually. And let me say thank you once again.

[Speaker 2]: You're welcome.
00:15:39

00:16:31

[Speaker 1]: On today's topic, we'll be discussing about racism. I have several questions to ask about it. Mr Liam, could you kindly tell us what is racism?
00:25:49

00:26:42

[Speaker 2]: Racism, to me, is discrimination or  by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership or particular racial or ethnic group.
00:45:52

00:48:05

[Speaker 1]: And while we are still at it, have you ever personally experienced or witnessed racism?
00:54:05

00:54:56

[Speaker 2]: Yes, I have two cases where I witnessed or I was a victim of racism. Number one, I was reported by my neighbors who thought I was a thief just because of my color.
01:15:18

01:15:18

[Speaker 1]: When was and where was this?
01:17:20

01:18:34

[Speaker 2]: This happened in the United States of America. I had gone to stay with my cousin. I went there as a student. Yes. Number two, the other case happened at school where students used to bully me because of my color, because of my race. And it really was a bad incident.
01:45:33

01:45:42

[Speaker 1]: So sorry about that. And how did it make you feel?
01:50:55

01:52:20

[Speaker 2]: I felt that my self esteem had gone down. I was insecure. I was also. And I also became antisocial. I was traumatized. Yes.
02:08:49

02:10:19

[Speaker 1]: So, Mr Liam, I'm so sorry to hear about that and the experience that you went through. And do you think racism is still an issue in today's society?
02:19:27

02:20:30

[Speaker 2]: Yes, racism still is an issue in today's society because it affects so many people, and it also causes mostly self esteem and you lose, or it affects the abilities of yourself.
02:42:26

02:44:26

[Speaker 1]: And How do you think we can work towards eradicating it?
02:48:13

02:49:49

[Speaker 2]: Racism can be worked to be eradicated in several ways. You can learn to recognize and understand your own privileges. By this, you can be checking your own privileges and using your privileges to dismantle systematic racism by race. You can examine your own biases and consider where they may have originated. In that case. I mean, you ask yourself as a kid, what messages did you receive about other people who are different from you? You can also validate the experiences and feelings of people of color. By that, you can do by supporting the experiences and engaging in tough conversation about race and injustices. You can also challenge the colorblind ideology. You can also call out racist jokers or correct them and educate them. You can find out how your school or your company, which you work in, is expanded or has expanded opportunities for people of color.
04:23:37

04:25:18

[Speaker 1]: Thank you very much, Mr Washira, for your time. To make us understand more about racism. And I'm really sorry about the experience that you had in the US. And hopefully people understand more about racism and those that are in the forefront to make sure that people feel insecure the way you felt and antisocial the way you felt because of racism, they really stop about it. Thank you once again for agreeing to be on board with us.
05:00:48

05:01:47

[Speaker 2]: Thank you so much for inviting me. And thank you so much for sharing about racism. One thing I would like to tell people, people should always fight racism. It's not good and it always affects your self esteem. That is the first thing racism does.
05:23:06

05:24:57

[Speaker 1]: Thank you.

[Speaker 1]: All right, so our topic for today is, can celebrities make good politicians?
00:24:32

00:25:16

[Speaker 2]: No, they cannot.
00:26:53

00:27:13

[Speaker 1]: So you believe that they cannot?
00:28:45

00:29:00

[Speaker 2]: Yes, they cannot, because they don't have the experience that the politicians have. And they don't have, like, genuine interest in politics and are often against it and cannot make better decisions than the current ones.

00:29:56

[Speaker 1]: Okay
00:30:34

00:52:03

[Speaker 1]:  than the current politicians. All right, so I do get your point, but I also believe that they can, you know, they can be politicians, because I believe that everybody should be given a chance. You know, when you're given a chance, that's why you will flourish in what you were given a chance to. You know, because they were also giving the,  the musicians, they were given a chance to make music. So that's when they, they knew how to make music. They knew how to entertain people. That's when they had the influence on people.
01:36:52

01:36:23

[Speaker 2]: They entertain people, not set the rules.
01:40:55

01:41:03

[Speaker 1]: Yeah, I do.
01:42:02

01:42:25

[Speaker 2]: They are used to making the, the entertainment, not the rules. Like, then they cannot. Like, they don't have any experience. And it's hard for them. Like, because now they're older and.
01:55:37

01:56:40

[Speaker 1]: No, but I do believe that if they are given a chance, they can be politicians, you know, because what I know for a fact is that our, I won't say the names, but our previous presidents, some of them, I know two of them actually, that did not go to high school. They do not have high school until now. They don't have high school education.
02:26:55

02:27:56

[Speaker 2]: That's the thing. They don't have high school education. But that time when they didn't go to high school, what did they do? Go study law? Go study politics?
02:40:05

02:41:12

[Speaker 1]: Who, the politicians?
02:42:21

02:42:21

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
02:43:15

02:45:09

[Speaker 1]: You know, what, to prepare.
02:48:14

02:45:26

[Speaker 2]: They had enough time to prepare, yes.
02:49:19

02:50:31

[Speaker 1]: But I also believe that celebrities can also have time to prepare to become politicians. You know, because I believe that they are also entertainers, because they have ability to rule people into whatever that they are doing. So I believe that they do have a chance to become a good politicians. You know, they have the influence.
03:15:51

03:16:50

[Speaker 2]: Yes, they do. They have the influence, but the different type of influence. Like, for instance, musicians. Some of them are, like, beefing and stuff like that. So, like, obviously people are gonna be, like, scared and, you know
03:32:55

03:33:13

[Speaker 1]: But I also feel that if that's directed into the right direction, that beefing, it can actually do good for them as politicians, you know, because for you as well, I believe that if you're given a chance in something, you will be able to do it. Don't you think so?
03:54:27

03:54:27

[Speaker 2]: Yes, you can. But we have more experienced people to do politics. The celebrities don't, do not have the experience, and most of them are greedy, So.
04:11:06

04:12:42

[Speaker 1]: Politicians are greedy?
04:14:26

04:14:26

[Speaker 2]: Yes.
04:15:02

04:18:07

[Speaker 1]: Politicians are also greedy, man, you know? Yeah. So I believe that anyone can be whatever they want to be if they are presented with an opportunity, if the opportunity comes their way, you know, I can also become a politician if I want to. It is possible, you know? It is, with the experience that they have and with the experience that they can be given too. Because in order for you to have experience in something, you need to practice that.
05:08:11

05:08:11

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
05:09:05

05:09:05

[Speaker 1]: You know?
05:09:30

05:09:30

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
05:09:51

05:10:59

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. So they can really, imagine. I don't want to say their names, but. But, okay, imagine this rapper. He has so, so many followers, you know? Imagine him being a politician.
05:35:02

05:35:58

[Speaker 2]: Oh, and then, yeah, they have, like, most of them have, like, cult fans. Like, cult, like fans. So, like, they could lead the country to the wrong direction because they have all the influence, so they can do whatever they want, not with the influence they have. They can do, like, wrong things and do disruption and all those type of things. And I feel like they have, if they do make wrong decisions, their fans, their followers will follow them, which means, it won't be a good
06:17:00

06:19:04

[Speaker 1]: It won't be a good party.
06:20:22

06:20:22

[Speaker 2]: Yeah.
06:20:48

06:22:34

[Speaker 1]: You know what? I feel that it has two sides.

Speaker 1]: Okay, Joy Muthoni, welcome to our today's session.

[Speaker 2]: I'm very humbled to be with you today.
00:19:08

00:20:43

[Speaker 1]: Welcome and to our first question, or we are discussing about rising fuel prices. Kindly let us know an overview of what is rising fuel prices.
00:37:12

00:38:04

[Speaker 2]: Once again, thank you, Mister Francis, for having me. Well, rising fuel prices refers to the increase in cost of gasoline, diesel and other fossil fuels used as source of energy. This phenomenon can occur due to a variety of factors such as global supply and demand, political instability, natural disasters, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As fuel prices continue to rise, it can have a significant impact on the economy, transportation, and the cost of living for individuals and businesses. Measures such as conservation efforts and exploring alternative energy sources are often implemented to address the effects of rising fuel prices. And that I believe we have understood each other up to that point.
01:38:13

01:39:39

[Speaker 1]: Now, have you noticed how the fuel prices have been rising lately?
01:44:50

01:46:16

[Speaker 2]: Yes, actually I've noticed that. And it's crazy how much it costs to fill up a tank these days.
01:53:46

01:55:01

[Speaker 1]: Okay, I heard that fuel prices are expected to go even higher. How do you think this will affect people's daily routines and expenses?
02:10:59

02:10:36

[Speaker 2]: First of all, the price of crude oil will go up and we know that this is the largest single component in the price of diesel fuel. Crude oil prices are. Crude oil prices are volatile and they can fluctuate significantly any time. Now, we have taxes. Taxes are another crucial factor in determining fuel prices. Many countries impose taxes such as excise taxes and value added taxes on fuel prices. Another one we have distribution, distribution and marketing cost. Once the fuel has been refined, it needs to reach the end consumer. The cost associated with the distribution becomes very high. We have the other one. We have a refining cost. Oil needs to be refined into gasoline before it can be used by consumers, which is why refining costs are factored into the price of gas. We have exchange rates, Mister Francis. On this one, oil is often traded in United States dollars. Therefore, currency exchange rates can affect fuel prices. A depreciation of a country's local currency can make the imported ones go very high. We have geopolitics. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters. When the price of crude oil increases, it becomes more expensive. We have fuel. Natural gas prices are affected by market supply and demand. US natural gas production increased in recent years. Economic growth can affect natural gas in a very big way. We have energy policy.  In this one, fuel prices influence energy policy decisions as governments may implement measures to encourage energy conservation and reduce dependence. And we also have disasters when it comes to disasters, natural disasters can cause crude oil to. to fluctuate by affecting the oil supply. Now we have market speculation. Speculative trading in the commodities market can lead to price volatility in the oil markets. Australia's respond to perceived supply and demand. We have supply, Mister Francis, supply has an effect on price. Supply is usually kept slightly below demand by about 1 million barrels per day. Now, we have demand rather transport. Mister Francis. On this one, transportation costs affect prices and generally increase based on the distance between the retail location and the sources of supply. We have demand. When demand for diesel is high, prices tend to increase. This is because there is more competition for the limited supply of diesel in the demands and we have weather. Natural disasters like hurricanes can disrupt refining operations leading to shortages which drive up gas prices. We have demand for oil. Supply and demand for crude oil refinery production and capacity. The pound to dollar exchange rate as refined fuel is sold in the US dollars. And we have factors that affect gas prices. Gasoline prices are one of the most recognizable prices points in the American commerce. Nearly 40 million Americans fill up the gases. We have seasonal demand. On this one, seasonal changes greatly influence crude oil prices. For example, prices tend to rise in August when people travel and demand gasoline more. We have economic growth. During periods of economic growth increased, rather increased demand for goods and services from the commercial and industrial sectors may increase natural gas consumption. That's all for today Mister Francis. 
06:36:47

06:37:09

[Speaker 1]: Do you think you have any other factor or you have exhausted or?
06:40:51

06:41:25

[Speaker 2]: Oh nice. We also have OPEC. The difference between oil market demand and supply from non OPEC sources is often referred to as the call on OPEC because OPEC members maintain the world's oil prices. We have taxes. On this, the federal, state, county and the local government. The relative share of these components in the retail price of a gallon of diesel fuel varies over time. That's all,  Mr. Francis,

00:20:28

00:22:46

[Speaker 1]: Welcome. So on to our first question. And before I proceed to the first question, the topic of the day today is day school versus boarding school. Can you kindly let me know the difference between a day school and a boarding school?
00:38:39

00:39:55

[Speaker 2]: Once again, thank you very much for having me. I will proceed by explaining what the two of them means. Day school and boarding school are two different educational systems that cater to students at different stages of their academic journey. Day school, also known as traditional schooling, involves students attending classes during the day and returning home in the evening. On the other hand, boarding schools provide students with a residential option where they stay on campus and receive both academic and extracurricular instructions. While day school offers students the comfort of living at home, boarding school provides a more immersive learning experience with 24/7 access to the facilities and resources. Both school options have their advantages and disadvantages.
01:35:22

01:36:40

[Speaker 1]: Thank you so much, Ruth, for that explanation and I'm very satisfied. Now let's go to the first question of the day. So have you ever attended a boarding school before? I'm curious how it compares to traditional day schools.
01:56:18

01:57:33

[Speaker 2]: Yes, actually I've been to boarding schools all my primary level, high school level and my campus level. And your question was how do the both of them compare? First of all, we have independence. Life has many highs and lows. The best way to learn how to cope and thrive in whatever the circumstance lies in making decisions for yourself and becoming self reliant. It can be a tough experience at first, but with time this independence will make you more confident and mature. A boarding school environment gives greater room for students to develop independent skills in a supportive environment. It also enables you to learn how to live more comfortable with people of different backgrounds, an ability that will be useful when students become adults and have to live, study and work on their own. Now on to the second one. We have responsibility. Without parents constantly monitoring students, they also learn how to take personal responsibility for themselves. From managing money to keeping their dorm space tidy. They encounter many situations where they have to think of actions and consequences. This again helps them to become more mature and able to succeed in future. Now, when they have no supervision at all, they can be able to do all that without anyone following them. Learning to take responsibility for themselves will mold them into well rounded individuals better able to succeed in life. The third one we have life and soft skills. When we think of school, lots of the classroom books and labs come to mind. Boarding school, however, provide a more holistic education beyond books. Since students get to spend entire days at a stretch with classmates in and out of the classroom, they often build stronger ties and social networks, not forgetting friendship among themselves. Another comparison is that there is individual attention. Boarding schools tend to have much smaller classrooms. This means teachers can pay greater attention to the needs and performance of individual students, helping them to discover their strengths and weaknesses. This greater individual attention ensures shortcomings are identified and addressed early so that students perform better academically and have a better chance of gaining admission to the universities of their choice. This deeper interaction between the teachers and the students ensure better mentorship and stronger communication whereby students learn to become more at ease speaking up in the classroom and engaging in discussion. This mostly happened to me. I was really in a position to ask questions because there was a time I was not in that position, but due to the interaction with the teachers and the students, I gained even more courage to ask questions during lesson time where I never understood properly. Another comparison is networking. Having to live, study and play together. It encourages deeper bonds between students. The friendships they make will often be lasting and carry and or rather can carry on to the time they enter university and later build their careers. Many boarding schools host a multicultural student body that give opportunities to explore cultural differences and learn how to appreciate diversity. Many boarding schools are highly selective of the students they admit they choose that they demonstrate strong potential and ambition to make achievements. Another one we have the academic rigor. Boarding schools make for a more intense academic life. There is greater investment in the required support systems including highly qualified teachers, well equipped laboratories, well stocked libraries, media centers and other technologies. Teachers design lessons and apply teaching modalities that make for more challenging learning that boost critical thinking and problem solving. Another one we have learning focus. Intellectual stimulation is quite high in boarding school environment. There is better recognition and nurturing of academic prowess causing students to be highly motivated. This stimulation comes from both teachers and fellow students who create an atmosphere both in and out of the classroom where there is an emphasis on academic achievement and we have co curricular activities. Most boarding schools have also heavily invested in their arts programs and sporting facilities. Students with an interest or talent in co curricular activities will certainly find a niche they can explore and be trained in. Sports team will often compete with other schools providing opportunities to bring recognition to the school and their personal achievement on the field. This success can also help to enhance their applications to universities and where they have excels provide a chance to secure scholarships. We have convenience. Boarding schools means no morning or after school commute for parents and students, there is more time that can be devoted to studying and co curricular activities in a safe and controlled environment. For parents that often have to travel, it is a comfort to know that their child is well catered to in a learning environment tailored to help them succeed in their ambitions. Last but not least, we have meaningful reunion. Absence makes the heart grow fonder in clearly proven where it comes to boarding schools. The joy that students and their families feel at being reunited over holiday periods is very strong. Actually, plans are more often made to make these reunions more meaningful by organizing trips and other activities where there's more interaction and much fun to be had. This can serve to strengthen family bonds in spite of the separation.
08:54:32

08:55:35

[Speaker 1]: Wow. The second question is I've been considering sending my child to a boarding school, but I'm not sure if it's the right choice. Have you ever had any experiences with it?
09:10:04

09:11:27
Speaker 2: With the experience that I gained, actually, sending your child to a boarding school is something that you cannot regret as a parent. First of all, cost of education. Almost all parents are aware that boarding schools are more expensive than day schools, but few are aware of the reasons why. Because in a day school, students attend class only during designated times. They go to class, finish up and then head home. But boarding schools students, with the exception of their breaks, they spend their whole time on campus and in this place. Rather in this place, the cost difference exists owing to the supply of services such as lodging, meals, health security measures, school stationery and so on. Another thing to consider is self sufficiency and self assurance. Children who study in boarding school atmosphere complete all of their responsibilities. They learn to provide for themselves since they must complete their tasks without the assistance of others. They address their everyday difficulties and attend their requirements such as purchasing essential items when they run out of them or ensuring that their school uniforms are cleaned and pressed. As a result, they grow more self sufficient, disciplined and autonomous. Also constant guidance. Only some youngsters have the same gripping ability. While some kids pick up on topics quickly, others require more time to comprehend. Teachers at a day school are only accessible for limited time and pupils may not have enough opportunity to put their concerns since teachers are only available for a limited time, which make you, which helps you even to consider more taking your child to a boarding school. We have physical fitness. By stressing the component of physical fitness both day school and boarding school include athletics as part of their curriculum. However, many boarding institutions have the extra benefit of putting a focus on physical health. Students spend more time playing games which lead to improved physical condition. This keeps them healthy both physically and emotionally. Additionally, involvement in school sports programs benefit kids chances of getting into college, expanding their range of employment options, and generally improving the quality of life. We have development on all levels. Academic success used to be the main goal, with sports and extracurricular activities being overlooked, but with increased competition, children are expected to excel in various fields of study, expression, athletics, theatre, singing, dancing and so on. Day schools include extracurricular activities, but pupils are unable to take advantage of them owing to a lack of time. However, boarding school students are free to spend their time participating in a variety of extracurricular activities throughout the day. This provides kids with a better platform to discover themselves and their abilities. We have safety, care and monitoring. One of the primary worries of the of parents is their child's safety. Both day school and boarding schools stress student safety, but boarding schools goes above and beyond since they are solely responsible for the children. Most boarding schools adopt safety and monitoring procedures that make use of modern technology to accomplish this. We also have, and sorry we have compared to typical schools, these employ a greater number of security professionals. And my final words are this. With so many benefits and chances available, boarding schools turn out to be the best decision for both parents and children, which is why many parents prefer them over day schools.
