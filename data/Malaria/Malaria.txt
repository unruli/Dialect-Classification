So, I'm thinking you're having a condition, you're having malaria. So, but what what would need to do is we'll need to confirm. We'll take blood samples to the lab, we'll do erm… malaria parasite test. So, if it comes out positive, we'll give you medications for malaria, but for now we'd give you paracetamol for the fever and the erm… headache and the body pains. So, we’d also like you to, you know,  bed rest if you need erm… notes for school to maybe exempt you from school, we can also issue that for you. Do you have any other thing you’d like you know like me to help with? So I'll direct you to the lab, where they’ll do the test and while we await the test results alright. Have… any other thing?
